# Minirel_DBMS
A project I completed for my DBMS course. Collaborated with 2 other students to create a mini database management system in C++.

`p2`: ER diagram design, relational schema design, and SQL queries.

`part3`: C++ implementation of the buffer manager.

`Stage4`: C++ implementation of the heapfile.

`stage6`: C++ implementation of the relational operators.


We only have to complete the 3 core part of the mini DBMS, stage 5 was the textual interface. There were basic skeleton code provided.
