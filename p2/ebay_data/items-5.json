Payments and Shipping (Visa, Master Card Directly OR Paypal) You will be sent an automated email after the auction ends. Please read it and follow the instructions.

You can call to make payment with a credit card, (702) 431-7667. Or email me a request and I will call you. I also accept money orders and checks. Personal Checks are held 10 days before item is shipped, UNLESS you are an established customer. Include a note with your personal check, that you are a repeat buyer. All shipments are sent through UPS Ground. Please allow up to 10 days before inquiring about package. It takes longer but it is safer than USPS. You may also upgrade the shipping for an additional charge. Any two items won are shipped together at no additional charge. Three or more items are charged at a discount of 50% of the total shipping. (Example: if 3rd item is $6.00 alone, it will only be $3.00 when added with the other two) International bidders shipping is quoted through UPS ONLY (due to lost packages through USPS). International bidders are encouraged to ask in advance for shipping cost via UPS since these rates are higher. If a International buyer backs out of sale because of shipping costs through UPS after the auction, ebay will be notified as a non-paying bidder. Additionally, duties through customs may be charged by your country. The package's value will be sent as the auction final price. It is illegal to send items marked as \"gift\", please do not ask.

Please use your in-house credit within 30 days. Due to high number of returns for reasons such as: \"bought for my friend and they didn't like it\" or items being returned blind with no information, I regret having to implement these terms. It appears there is a high number of new ebayers who are reckless bidding and then returning items. This will hopefully eliminate irresponsible bidding. My good ebay customers have always given careful consideration before bidding and to them, I apologize in advance for implementing these terms. ANY ITEM(S) MISREPRESENTED DUE TO LISTING ERRORS, FLAWS OR DEFECTS WILL BE FULLY REFUNDED INCLUDING SHIPPING BOTH WAYS! If you have any questions regarding refunds and exchanges, please feel free to email me in advance or call 702 431-7667. Measuring Coat Sizes & Best Fit Tips CHEST: Take a tape measure and place it under your arms completely around your body with your arms to your side (don't hold your breath), but measure the biggest part of your chest. *This will determine the size of your chest and the size of the coat you need. You can always go a size or so bigger in the coat. I measure about 1.5in below the armpit seam laid flat. SLEEVES: Take the tape measure with your arm at your side and measure from the top of your shoulder to your wrist bone. Remember: your shirt sleeve length is different since it is measured from the back of the neck. I measure from the top seam to cuff. WAIST: Make sure if your waist is bigger than your chest size, wear your waist size or you will not be able to button the jacket. (example: you have a 46\" waist, but your chest is 44\", get a 46\" chest) SHOULDER TO SHOULDER: This is the spread of your back where your shoulder blades are and the sleeves of the coat are attached. Measure from your armpit to the other armpit (you may need someone to do it). Make sure if you are broad, you get a size that won't bind. If you are really broad, try an athletic fit or even one size bigger chest will help. I measure in the middle of the back where the arm seams are attached. *Note: Add 2 or 3\" to your chest for the new 3 button jackets. Always buy your height size correctly. Short,Regular,Long Slacks should only be taken in or let out about 2in in the waist European Suit and Sportcoats: Subtract 10 (-10) to determine US size. European slacks: Subtract 16 (-16) to determine the US size. For more Clothing and Fabric Information, please go to my website. Auction Tools for Success!

Details on payment and shipping terms are listed below, or you can visit my \"About Me\" page (click here) for more information By placing a bid, you are agreeing to my terms of sale, which cannot be changed after the auction has ended. Special Note: I will be out of town from December 23rd through the 26th - payments and email messages received during that time will not be processed until the 27th. ...THE FINE PRINT... After the auction ends: If you win this auction, an email message with details about payment and shipping instructions will be sent to you on December 19th or 20th. DO NOT USE EBAY's CHECKOUT! Please wait until after you receive my email message before sending payment. If you do not receive an email message from me within three days of the close of the auction, assume it was somehow lost in transit, and contact me at matthigh@aol.com. About the condition and grade of my comics: I'm one of those people who believe comics should primarily be read and enjoyed instead of just collected. And because of this, the overall condition of a comic book is not very important to me. I am not an experienced grader of comic books, and I do not make a serious effort to grade comic books (so please do not ask me to give a firm grade on a book). However... most of the comics I am selling are in very nice condition . About half have never been read (got it directly from the publisher), and most of the rest have only been read once or twice. The comic book may show \"normal reading wear\" (such as a few of those tiny little fingernail marks on the cover that show up when you turn the comic edgewise to a light), or slight storage wear (such as light rubbing along the spine from moving around in storage boxes). If a comic shows more than light reading wear, I will make a note about its condition in the description above. If a comic book is more \"valuable\", (for example, if it is considered rare, or regularly sells for ten dollars or more), I will make an extra effort to describe the condition in detail. All individually-purchased comic books will be shipped in new comic boards and bags, and securely packaged against damage. (Out of over a thousand shipments sent over the past two years, I've had no complaints about damage in transit!) Payment details: If you have an Ebay Feedback rating of more than 10, you can send payment by PayPal (preferred), money order, or personal check. If you have an Ebay Feedback rating of 10 or less, and have not done business with me in the past, payment is only accepted by PayPal or money order DO NOT SEND CASH! I will not be held responsible for cash lost in the mail. Payment is due within 10 days after the auction has ended. If payment is not received within 21 days after the auction has ended, your auction may be cancelled, negative feedback left on your account, and a Non-Paying Bidder Alert submitted to Ebay. I do make exceptions to this rule for overseas customers, and by special request (infrequently), but I try to be as firm as I possibly can about my \"21-day\" rule. After I receive your payment, I will email you to confirm payment has been received, the list of comics shipping to you, and your shipping address. Shipping details: I ONLY send comic books by U.S. Priority Mail with delivery confirmation -- this is the only shipping option available, so please do not ask about other shipping methods (such as \"media mail\" or \"parcel post\"). I absolutely refuse to haggle on shipping costs, so please don't ask. Shipping and handling is a flat-rate charge of $4.00 for every 15 comic books, per shipment, within the United States. And yes, you can combine several auctions into one shipment to save on shipping charges -- in fact, I encourage it! So, if you purchase between 1 and 15 comics, the shipping charge is $4.00, between 16-30 comics, the charge is $8.00, and so on. For customers in Canada and Mexico, the shipping charge is $7.00 for every 15 comic books, and for customers outside North America the shipping charge is $9.00 for every 15 comic books (sent by Global Priority Mail). Please be sure that you agree to the payment and shipping terms of sale before placing your bid! Additional notes: Please do not email me to see if I have other comics available -- ONLY items currently up for auction are for sale! My comic collection is unsorted, and I can't easily search through it to answer specific requests. For a complete list of all items I have up for sale this week, visit my \"About Me\" page (click here) . I do not participate in Ebay's \"Checkout\" program! I will contact you by email with complete payment and shipping details. For all successfully-completed auctions, I leave positive feedback. If I do not receive payment, I will leave negative feedback. Do not ask me to end an auction early, or sell an item at a fixed price. Once an auction has started, I let it run its course. All adults-only items will be listed in Category #1604. Sorry, but you can't pick up your items in person. I have the right to cancel bids on my auctions. About Me and what I have for sale: I have been a professional publisher and distributor of comic books for almost ten years, beginning with Antarctic Press, and currently with Radio Comix and Cold Cut Distribution. I'm not selling these comic books for profit -- I'm selling them to work my way out of a deep, five-figure debt. It's a lot of work, but I'm now about a third of the way to solvency, and I plan to continue to offer comics for sale on Ebay until I'm in the black (which at this rate probably won't be until June at the earliest). I have thousands of furry/anthropomorphic comics, \"American\" manga, translated manga, alternative press and adults-only comics, ranging from the mid-80's to the present. Many of the comics are common and often available in stores, but some of the items I dig up may be out-of-print, rare and hard-to-find key issues (I've already sold one Albedo vol. 1 #1, Genus #2 and #4, Furrlough #6, Tenchi Muyo #1 and #2, Shanda #1, etc, for example). Many of the comics (especially the older ones) are from my own personal collection, and most of the rest are various books I have picked up at conventions, stores, or by mail over the past few years. Each week, I'm offering a different \"block\" of items up for sale. One week, it may be all furry comics. Then the next week, all manga. For a tentative calendar of future auctions, see the top of my \"About Me\" page (click here) . I try to offer lots of related items at the same time so that you can bid on several items at once and save on shipping costs. If you have any doubts about my reputation as a comics seller, see my Feedback Page -- as of mid-November, not a single valid negative feedback! (No doubt I'll eventually get a dissatisfied customer for one reason or another, but it hasn't happened yet!). If you have any other questions, please email me at matthigh@aol.com. I'm not great at replying to email questions quickly (it may take me a few days to answer your question), but I do try to answer all email questions that are sent to me.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

It seems like it's the few DEADBEAT BIDDERS, that mess things up for everyone else......jeez. * * * CLICK HERE TO VIEW OUR OTHER EBAY AUCTIONS!!! * * * Please don't be one of the people left out in the cold after the auction has ended simply because you were unable to bid at the last second and missed the item you wanted. There's a better way to win an auction, and it's called PROXY BIDDING . Let's say you find something on eBay that you want... You're willing to pay $25.00 for it, but the current bid price is only $2.25. You could take the long route and sit at your computer, outbidding each new bid until you reach $25.00. Luckily, there's a better way. Here's how it works: Decide the maximum you're willing to pay and enter this amount. eBay will now confidentially bid up to your maximum amount. In this way, you don't have to keep an eye on your auction as it unfolds. If other bidders outbid your maximum at the end of the auction, you don't get the item. But otherwise, you're the winner--and the final price might even be less than the maximum you had been willing to spend! Remember: eBay will use only as much of your maximum bid as is necessary to maintain your position as high bidder. Winning was never easier!!! Free counters provided by Andale .

Two nomadic populations, the Kashkai and the Khamseh, weave the rugs. The techniques of the two groups are so similar they are indistinguishable from each other and so are referred to as Shiraz. These carpets generally contain a central medallion or superimposed medallions. Most often the field contains small geometric motifs such as polygons, eight pointed stars, stylized birds and animals or \"hens\" called morghi. Narrow borders with multicolored panels along the short sides are also characteristic of the Shiraz. Stylized lions also appear, representing strength and domination. The rugs are brightly colored, with strong reds, deep blues and some ivory. Village rugs are woven using the asymmetrical knot and tribal rugs with the symmetrical knot. They average about 60-200 knots per square inch. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

Payment: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover ONLY Detail: Rich olive green glows like honey from this superior pair of bowls by Boonsant Photikanond. Two flap-like handles add symmetry and practicality to the smooth contours of the pieces. They are a fine example of the exquisite celadon work of Boonsant Photikanond who goes on to tell us about the intricacies of his methods representing a centuries-old Thai art. \"...Celadon is a kind of high-fired stoneware where the glazed surface is lustrous. Celadon glazes have traditionally been highly prized and the earliest known was coined \"pi-se,\" or \"secret color.\" Celadon wares were admired for their resemblance to jade, and at their best, celadon glazes may have the look and feel of precious stone. The glazes have almost indescribable hues, ranging from a sea green through olive green, blue green, and yellow green to gray green. It takes me 25 days to make a single piece, and here is how I make my celadon: the clay is mixed and turned in the pug mill and the \"cake\" obtained is left covered for two nights. Next I let the cake dry at room temperature for about four hours, after which I cut and shape the objects into their specified shapes and leave them to dry again at room temperature for two weeks. After that, I polish them with sandpaper. I then fire them at 800 degrees Celsius for about five hours. This process is called \"biscuit\" firing. Later I use sharp tools to remove unwanted particles - such as very fine iron and carbon pigment particles - by hand. It's a time-consuming process requiring a lot of concentration. If I miss any particles, they will appear on the surface of the celadon after the final firing. Then I dip the objects into the glaze. After the glaze has dried, I will work on each object to make sure that the glaze has a uniform thickness. Then I leave the object to dry at room temperature for four days before firing them at 1280 degrees Celsius for twelve hours. The final firing stage is considered the most important since the slightest error could change the color of all the objects. The process must be carried out strictly in accordance with established procedures. I leave the objects in the kiln for 16 hours and open it the next day. While opening the kiln's door, the characteristic sound of the celadon glaze cracking can be heard. Three to four hours later, I can pull the carrier out of the kiln and leave the objects to cool down at room temperature. I then control the quality of each piece and polish the bottom to make sure that it stands properly on the table. Only then I put them on the storage shelves.\" Free of lead and other toxins.

I was born in Ratchaburi province and I moved to Chiang Mai in 1959. I have been a celadon specialist for 30 years. My celadon products are handmade following ancient techniques that Chinese potters brought into Thailand 700 years ago; but this art slowly died out. I initially worked for the celadon company in Chiang Mai that revived this industry, 28 years ago, after which I decided to set up my own business intending to market celadon abroad but also in my own country. I now run a celadon family business that I set up in 1988. \"The intricacies of the methods and the expertise built up by my family for over 30 years enable us to produce high quality celadon ware and the finest dinnerware in the market. In general terms celadon is made by a method similar to any ceramic but the work is more refined and the glaze is made from natural materials without any chemical pigments. The natural color of celadon comes from the secret mixture of the glaze solution that has been developed for years and the condition used in the firing process. The slightest change in the process could turn the celadon into a different color than anticipated. I constantly challenge myself with five colors: cream, light green, light blue, blue and red. I have barely changed my techniques over the years, but rather have improved them so as to meet people's satisfaction. \"I regularly teach my factory's workers and my relatives. I exhibited my work at the 'Department of Export Promotion' and received an award from the Ministry of Industry. I am impressed by the way NOVICA uses the Internet to connect artisans to the world. I want to take that chance to say to appreciators around the world that I wish they would be interested in genuine celadon products. Because the market is nowadays flooded with imitations that do not really use natural glaze, and that kills the real celadon industry, not to mention our Thai heritage that I love so much. \"Our celadon ware is made from natural materials. Its glaze contains neither synthetic materials nor commercial dyes.\" Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Visit NOVICA.com today!

A young Professor X stopped him, but the victory cost him the use of his legs. Now Professor X claims he has evidence of a massive secret Quistalian invasion plan. To stop it he orders the X-Men on a series of urgent missions to three abandoned Quistalian facilites, one in the Andes, one in Central Africa, and one in Antarctica. The purpose is to seize key pieces of alien technology from the scattered sites and assemble that technology into a defense weapon to stop the Quistalian invasion. But is the invasion a lie? Does Professor X have a different, hidden agenda. Normal human Jeffrey Saunders seems to have the answers to the troubling questions of Professor X's bizarre behavior. But his answers don't make things easier, if anything, they make things worse for the X-Men. Meanwhile, the countdown for the invasion continues.... Mint Condition. Hardback. 328 pages. No Reserve.

The cornerstone of the chapel was laid on September 7, 1936. The first service was held almost a year later on September 19, 1937 and the chapel were dedicated on April 10, 1938 as the Cadet Chapel. After General Summerall's retirement as president of the Citadels in June of 1953, the name was officially changed to the General Charles Pelot Summerall Chapel. All of the stained glass was designed at a single studio and consequently is concordant throughout. The woodwork was designed in the style of fourteenth century Gothic and the lighting fixtures are handmade of wrought iron. On the left rear of the chapel grounds is the Thomas Dry Memorial Carillon which houses one of the Western Hemisphere's largest Dutch Bell installations. It was dedicated to the memory of Major Thomas Dry Howie, class of 1929 who was killed in action during World War II on July 17, 1944. -----This is made of wood and painted by Sheila's.

Those handles are connected to the bronze parts by some sort of rivet and a few are a little loose and I think one is broken.

The designs are somewhat similar, just a little bit of difference but mostly alike. There are lots of forks, spoons, knives, and serving pieces - a total of 78 I think we counted.
