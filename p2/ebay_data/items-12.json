Up for auction is the original lobby card for the 1965 British (a Hammer film) thriller The Nanny, starring the extraordinary Bette Davis in a chilling performance that only an actress of her stature could perform. The card itself, number 2 of the set, features Miss Davis with her charge. This lobby card is in black and white, with a striking red border. The lobby card is in good condition, but not perfect. There are a few pinholes (margin only); an inch tear on the upper right margin, and is a bit worn. Otherwise, it is a nice specimen. The lobby card retains its beautiful color and the paper is real smooth. It measures 14 x 11 inches. What is great about movie lobby cards compared to movie posters is that they are compact; easily and cheaply frame-able; affordable; and small enough to hang on a wall without overpowering wall space. They make a very good investment too, since lobby cards are slowing becoming extinct as a result of videos being used to advertise movies. This piece of movie memorabilia is a definitely a must-have. They make a GREAT gift too! Payment and Shipping The winner pays $3.95 for priority shipping & confirmation.

This dynamic duo was signing copies of their new book \"The Producers: The Biggest Hit in the History of Broadway, How We Did It.\" The Producers is perhaps the hottest Broadway show of all time. You can't even think about getting tickets from the box office. People around the city are paying anything to get their hands on these tickets in any location. This is all of course the result of the comic genius of the legendary Mel Brooks. He has done countless comic classics like Blazing Saddles, History of the World, ect. Nothing has brought him more success than The Producers with its astonishing and unprecedented 12 Tony awards. This wonderful coffee table style book describes the play in detail with song lyrics, pictures and lines. It is an unforgettable volume on this once and a lifetime play. This would make a spectacular christmas gift for anyone who can or cannot make it to see this great play. I will be posting photos of Mel and Tom signing and of the book in a few hours if it is not up when you read this. I will include a flyer from Barnes and Noble as proof of the signing. Who knows what it will sell for the cover price alone on the book was $40. You don't want to miss this one. You can easily have this in time for christmas with timely payment. Shipping for this heavy book is $6.50. E-mail all questions. PAYPAL available, but NO CREDIT CARDS. Here is a review of the Book from Barnes and Noble.com Mel Brooks once again delights audiences with his ingenious, infectiously, irreverent humor, knocking 'em dead on Broadway with the hottest ticket in town, The Producers. Brooks's raucous musical comedy, with the impossibly charismatic duo Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) and Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) as the wily producers who cook the books and conspire to produce the worst musical ever, has won an unprecedented twelve Tony Awards (including best musical, best direction, best actor, and best original score for Brooks) and has been hailed \"a gift from the show-biz gods\" (Time magazine). This is the definitive account of a once-in-a-lifetime show. With characteristic candor, Mel Brooks and co-librettist Tom Meehan give an intimate glimpse of the musical Brooks calls his \"love letter to Broadway.\" They explain the process of turning an idea into a show and detail how the creative team, which includes director/choreographer Susan Stroman and musical arranger Glen Kelly, has made The Producers into a smash hit. This lavishly illustrated book presents the libretto of the musical, in addition to such treats as annotated excerpts and never-before-seen outtakes. It contains Brooks's Tony Award-winning original songs, plus a hilarious send-up of Oklahoma! that never made it to the stage, entitled Hey, Nebraska! This book is a thrilling collection of brilliant costume and set illustrations, gorgeous photographs of scenes from the production and rehearsals, and personal photographs and anecdotes from the cast and crew. The Producers: The Book, Lyrics, and Story behind the Biggest Hit in Broadway History! pays tribute to the genius of the show, capturing permanently the magic and wild hilarity of this Broadway phenomenon.

It has very heavy plate wear to both sides of the blade. The pattern shows a man holding a cup and a bunch of grapes. The pattern is crisp on this piece. The luncheon fork is about 7 inches long and has never been monogrammed. It has been professionally replated and the tines have been evened out (filed down). The pattern shows a woman in a toga-style dress. There is some wear to the pattern on this piece, but you can still see the folds in the woman's dress. The spoon is about 5 13/16 inches long and has never been monogrammed. It is probably a sugar spoon, but could be an ice cream spoon. It does have a lot of plate wear (especially to the heel of the spoon, where it rests on the table) and some pitting. The pattern shows a figure playing pan-pipes. There is some wear to the pattern.

Softbound book (the true first edition), a parody of the JRR Tolkien book. Written 32 years before the movie - but here now for you Hobbit fans. Covers creased, otherwise very good. Buyer pays actual postage cost rounded up to the nearest dollar plus a one dollar handling fee (but keep reading to see how you may be able to get that handling fee back). I don_t mind shipping by book rate. And I don_t mind shipping winnings from different auctions together to save you postage. I do not take credit cards directly but you can pay by credit card on-line through Billpoint (now called ebay payment services, or something like that). Because Billpoint is more work for me and costs me money I will reward buyers who pay me by cash, check or money order by giving them a discount of one dollar off of the final selling price. I DO NOT TAKE PAYPAL BECAUSE I DO NOT CONSIDER PAYPAL AN ETHICAL COMPANY. LOOK AT MY EBAY ABOUT ME PAGE (click on this link to connect) OR ASK ME FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE CONCERNED OR CURIOUS. The winning bidder will be expected to do two things: 1) contact me within three days of the end of the auction to confirm an intent to buy; and 2) pay within two weeks. These are two different things I'm asking you to do. I'm really not just being difficult - after four years and 6,000+ sales in ebay I have learned that I do need both of them. If you know you have a vacation or business trip coming up or will just be overwhelmed with other things that will interfere with contacting or paying me on time please get in touch with me ahead of time - I will be glad to talk about letting you take longer as long as I'm asked first. If you have questions feel free to ask. I am an ebay Power Seller, and try really really hard to make sales easy and fun for my winners. But if you're not going to pay me on time or contact me on time and are not going to ask for extra time either then please don_t bid - I do cancel sales; and I do give negative feedback to people who earn it, as a warning to other sellers; and I would be happier getting a few bucks less from someone else and not having to be mean. Check out other books, magazines, music and random amazing stuff I'm selling by clicking here: Seth_s other ebay stuff. Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions I do not use Checkout so that winners will be able to choose their shipping method - winners should contact me by email. I allow return within ten days of receipt of all items I sell. If I made a mistake in description or packing I will give full refund including postage both ways. If the buyer has simply changed his mind I will refund purchase price but not postage either way."}, {"ItemID": "1494501389", "Name": "NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS lunch tin box NEW!", "Category": ["Movies & Television", "Memorabilia", "Movie", "Other"], "Currently": "$12.99", "First_Bid": "$12.99", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "VIVA LAS VEGAS!", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-07-01 13:35:08", "Ends": "Dec-14-01 13:35:08", "Seller": {"UserID": "babushkababy", "Rating": "26"}, "Description": "Click to Enlarge NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS lunch tin box NEW with TAGS!

Shipping: Shipping is as follows: For bidders in Canada and the United States, I have to charge $5.00US for any item which is sent rolled (most modern posters) and $4.00US for any item sent flat (presskits, stills, lobby cards, folded posters). International customers should contact me for shipping costs. We send everything that is rolled in very strong mailing tube - custom made and guaranteed not to be damaged in the mail. For flat items, we wrap all items in plastic and custom cut strong cardboard and mail it in an envelope. All items are sent via air mail. We find that items will generally arrive within 2 weeks after the item is sent, but will occasionally take upwards of 4 weeks depending on postal factors (customs difficulties, lost or misdirected packages). If these delivery times are too long for you to wait, you can use the services of a courier company such as Federal Express and UPS, but you will be responsible for actual shipping charges. Please note, that there is NO TRACKING of items sent via airmail. If you want a tracking number you will have to use either FEDEX or UPS. We will make every effort to ensure that you item is sent securely, timely and well-packaged. However, we cannot be responsible for lost packages. If any of these terms are not acceptible to you, please do not bid on this auction. Please note that we will only mail packages twice a week - this is to avoid any possible mailing mix-ups. Payment Conditions: I will accept the following forms of payment: Cash (please keep it well disguised) Personal Cheque (I will have to hold your item until your cheque has cleared the bank). Certified Cheque Money Orders (please send only INTERNATIONAL money orders, domestic postal money orders can NOT be cashed here in Canada) BidPay Paypal If you wish to use a credit card, please use either BidPay or Paypal. All items paid with these services, or with money orders and certified cheque, will be sent immediately. About Me: I've been working in a movie theatre for over 40 years and have acquired and am still acquiring a large amount of movie posters and memorabilia. I've decided to sell off many of these items as I just don't have the space that I used to have. Most of the items I will be selling are duplicates though some of the items will be my only copy. I have asked a couple of friends to help me in this process and they will be doing most of the work for me, though I will make sure that everything is sent and properly described as it should be. If you have any further questions, please contact me. Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old french prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds - pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.

He was a Film animator, producer. Born December 5, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois, the fourth of five children. Disney was raised on a Midwestern farm in Marceline, Missouri, and in Kansas City, where he was able to acquire some rudimentary art instruction from correspondence courses and Saturday museum classes. He would later use many of the animals and characters that he knew from that Missouri farm in his cartoons. He dropped out of high school at the age of 17 to serve in World War I. After serving briefly overseas as an ambulance driver, Disney returned in 1919 to Kansas City for an apprenticeship as a commercial illustrator and later made primitive animated advertising cartoons. By 1922, he had set up his own shop in association with Ub Iwerks, whose drawing ability and technical inventiveness were prime factors in Disney's eventual success. Initial failure sent Disney to Hollywood in 1923, where in partnership with his loyal elder brother Roy, he managed to resume cartoon production. His first success came with the creation of Mickey Mouse in Steamboat Willie. Steamboat Willie was the first fully synchronized sound cartoon and featured Disney as the voice of a character first called \"Mortimer Mouse.\" Disney's wife, Lillian, suggested that Mickey sounded better and Disney agreed. Living frugally, he reinvested profits to make better pictures. His insistence on technical perfection and his unsurpassed gifts as story editor quickly pushed his firm ahead. The invention of such cartoon characters as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Minnie, and Goofy combined with the daring and innovative use of music, sound, and folk material (as in The Three Little Pigs) made the Disney shorts of the 1930s a phenomenon of worldwide success. This success led to the establishment of immensely profitable, Disney-controlled sidelines in advertising, publishing, and franchised goods, which helped shape popular taste for nearly 40 years. Disney rapidly expanded his studio facilities to include a training school where a whole new generation of animators developed and made possible the production of the first feature-length cartoon, Snow White (1937). Other costly animated features followed, including Pinocchio, Bambi, and the celebrated musical experiment Fantasia. With Seal Island (1948), wildlife films became an additional source of income, and in 1950 his use of blocked funds in England to make pictures like Treasure Island led to what became the studio's major product, live-action films, which practically cornered the traditional \"family\" market. Eventually the Disney formula emphasized slick production techniques. It included, as in his biggest hit, Mary Poppins, occasional animation to project wholesome, exciting stories heavily laced with sentiment and, often, music. In 1954, Disney successfully broke into television. By the time of his death, the Disney studio's output amounted to 21 full-length animated films, 493 short subjects, 47 live-action films, seven True-Life Adventure features, 330 hours of Mickey Mouse Club television programs, 78 half-hour Zorro television adventures, and 280 other television shows. On July 18, 1957, Disney opened Disneyland, a gigantic projection of his personal fantasies in Anaheim, California, which has proved the most successful amusement park in history with 6.7 million people visiting it by 1966. The idea for the park came to him after taking his children to other amusement parks and watching them have fun on amusement rides. He decided to build a park where the entire family could have fun together. In 1971, Disney World, in Orlando, Florida, opened. Since then, Disney theme parks have opened in Tokyo and Paris. Disney had also dreamed of developing a city of the future, a dream that was realized in 1982 with the opening of the Center for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT). EPCOT Center, which cost an initial $900 million, was conceived of as a real-life community of the future with the very latest in high technology. The two principle areas of EPCOT are Future World and World Showcase, both of which were designed to appeal to adults rather than children. In addition to his theme parks, Disney created and endowed a new university, the California Institute of the Arts, known as Cal Arts. He thought of this as the ultimate in education for the arts, where people in many different disciplines could work together, dream and develop, and create the mixture of arts needed for the future. Disney once commented: \"It's the principle thing I hope to leave when I move on to greener pastures. If I can help provide a place to develop the talent of the future, I think I will have accomplished something.\" Disney's parks continue to grow with the creation of the Disney-MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom, and a extensive sports complex in Orlando. The Disney Corporation has also branched out into other types of films with the creation of Touchstone Films, into music with Hollywood Records, and even vacationing with its Disney Cruise Lines. In all, the Disney name now lends itself to a multi-billion dollar enterprise, with multiple undertakings all over the world. In 1939, Disney received an honorary Academy Award and in 1954 he received four Academy Awards. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented Disney with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and in the same year Disney was awarded the Freedom Foundation Award. Happily married for 41 years, this moody, deliberately \"ordinary\" man was moving ahead with his plans for gigantic new outdoor recreational facilities when he died of circulatory problems on December 15, 1966, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Los Angeles, California. At the time of his death, his enterprises had garnered him respect, admiration, and a business empire worth over $100 million-a-year, but Disney was still remembered primarily as the man who had created Mickey Mouse over two decades before.

Michael Caine plays the old miser Scrooge with Kermit as his long-suffering but ever-hopeful employee Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Cratchit's wife, and a host of Muppets (including the Great Gonzo as an unlikely Charles Dickens) taking other primary roles in this bright, playful adaptation of the somber tale. Or at least it starts brightly enough--the anarchic humor soon settles into mirthful memories and a sense of melancholy as the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future take Scrooge on a journey of his lonely, wasted life. Michael Caine makes a wonderful Scrooge, delightfully rediscovering the meaning of life as fantastic creations from Henson's Creature Shop (developed specially for this film) take the reins as the three ghosts. While the odd mix of offbeat humor and somber drama undercuts the power of Dickens's drama, this kid-friendly retelling makes an excellent family drama that adults and children alike can enjoy.

The rootin' tootin' wild West is a rough place, with tumble-weed and gun-slingers around every corner, and these guys are forced to take the law into their own hands. A band of whiskey swillin' bad-dudes show up, and rape, pillage, and plunder the town, and Wyatt rounds up a group of do-gooders (kinda) to help him, including Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) & his brother_s Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) . These duster-wearing cow-pokes go one-on-one with the bad ones, and the results are some swell shoot-outs, and a few corpses in the road. It all comes down to the shoot-out at the O.K. Corral, so to speak, and who will be left standing when the dust settles and the gun-smoke clears? This is a classic Western, and many believe it to be the best Western of all time, and it's easy to see why. The realism level is very high, the movie leaves out the sugar-coated sections some Westerns use, and sticks with the grim and brutal aspects. The movie is extremely dark, sometimes pitch black, and with even the good guys clad in black, the scenes sometimes seem to be total darkness. It is very cohesive to the film to have this darker tone, because this movie shoots for a grittier, Hollywood-less Old West. Don_t miss out on your chance to own this awesome 5x7 COPY of REPRODUCED Authentic Autographs from this 1993 CLASSIC at an unbelievable low minimum bid.

If you would like to see them click here. For those of you who don t know, Mardi Gras doubloons are brightly colored aluminum coins about the size of a silver dollar. They are thrown by Krewe members from Mardi Gras floats. Doubloons usually have the symbol of the Krewe on the front along with the date the Krewe was organized, the back side usually has the theme for that years parade as well as the date. Each Krewe may have a number of different doubloons for each years parade. Usually the silver ones are the most common, followed by a range of colors from red to gold. Some Krewes mint real bronze, silver and even gold doubloons, however these are very rare and seldom put up for sale. Many Mardi Gras doubloons are fairly rare outside of New Orleans, and many are rare even in the city. They make great inexpensive yet unique collectibles or gifts. I am in the process of auctioning a number of doubloons from my collection. The subject matter of my individual doubloon auctions vary a great deal. I have coins for a lot of different themes.

ROBERT WARWICK original studio contact print negative is 5\" X 7\" ( CAN BE PRINTED IN LARGER SIZES ), condition is excellent. I used the computer to make a crude picture from the negative, it will print much nicer. YOU ARE BIDDING ON THE ORIGINAL 5X7 CONTACT PRINT NEGATIVE, NOT MY COMPUTER GENERATED PICTURE FROM THE NEGATIVE! This is a working negative that was used to produce photos sent to fans who wrote to the stars. It is 60+ to 70+ years old! Please check out my other auctions. This is part of a collection I aquired in the 1980's from a gentleman named Hal, who owned a used book & memorabilia shop in Southern California. Hal had connections in the industry and found out that original contact print negatives, fan photos & other great stuff was being thrown out. The negatives & pictures were from the silent era to the 1940's, and mostly fan photos with autographs printed from the negatives. This was in the 1950's and Hal sold this stuff for years. He sold me most of the negatives along with some other goodies. I've been selling them on eBay for the last two years. These contact print negatives can be printed in larger sizes. $3.00 insured shipping. Pay Pal (VISA & MASTERCARD), Checks (held 10 days)& Money Orders Accepted.

The Wizard of Oz (1939) Director: Victor Fleming Cast: Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton and Billie Burke For those of you who don t know, Mardi Gras doubloons are brightly colored aluminum coins about the size of a silver dollar. They are thrown by Krewe members from Mardi Gras floats. Doubloons usually have the symbol of the Krewe on the front along with the date the Krewe was organized, the back side usually has the theme for that years parade as well as the date. Each Krewe may have a number of different doubloons for each years parade. Usually the silver ones are the most common, followed by a range of colors from red to gold. Some Krewes mint real bronze, silver and even gold doubloons, however these are very rare and seldom put up for sale. Many Mardi Gras doubloons are fairly rare outside of New Orleans, and many are rare even in the city. They make great inexpensive yet unique collectibles or gifts. I am in the process of auctioning a number of doubloons from my collection. The subject matter of my individual doubloon auctions vary a great deal. I have coins for a lot of different themes. If you would like to see my other coins please CLICK HERE.. Shipping is only $.75 cents in the United States. Buy a number of coins and save on shipping. Thank you for looking at my auction, and have a nice day. NO RESERVE! Shipping for one doubloon is .75 cents.

DeMille epic starring Charlton Heston, Edward G. Robinson, Yul Brynner, Yvonne DeCarlo, John Derek, Debra Paget, Sir Cedric Hardwick Condition: fine. There are a few minor creases in the edges. All our stills are original theater 8x10s (re-issues are noted before the film description). Some may measure slightly smaller than 8x10 (in which case, you should see the image and compare the still to the ruler in the picture). View our other auctions and bid away, remember that you pay only one shipping charge (as long as it all fits in one package)! Shipping Terms: Your shipping cost on this item is $4 (non-US generally pays $10). Your item will be mailed Priority mail through the United States Post Office. Insurance is NOT included. Insurance is an extra $1.10. We can not be responsible for the package if you don't pay for insurance. We use the boxes that the Post Office provides. We are always trying to determine new ways to ship your items cheaper but in such a way that the items are received in the condition described. We'd like to think that each package you receive from us will be better than the last! Payment Options: You can pay with PayPal (preferred), check, or money order. I do NOT accept eBay checkout or Billpoint/eBay Payments. If that option shows up, please disregard it as I simply don't accept it. Return Policy: If the item is not in the condition we have described, let us know within 5 days and we'll refund your bid and shipping both ways. Contact us first whenever you have a problem. Why Our Auctions Instead of Someone Else's? We try to accurately describe the condition of what we sell, most times making it sound worse than it really is. The reason we do this is that we've purchased way too many items that say \"Fine to Near Mint\" when it was really in \"good to very good\" condition. We don't think you should have to deal with that kind of mentality. Unlike other sellers you may have dealt with, we know what it is to be a collector! When we say that an item is \"original\" we mean that it IS original. Many other sellers don't realize that there is a difference between \"Theater\" and \"Video\" or \"Original release\" and \"reissue\". We know all that stuff. When we claim an item is something, it is what we claim. If you EVER buy an item and find that we misdescribed it as something it isn't, send it back for a full refund. This means you don't have to worry about whether the item is really a theater poster or a video poster. US or Australian. Spanish or Mexican. So, bid with confidence! We have movie paper available every week! Be sure to visit our auctions every week as we have tons of movie memorabilia! We start all our movie paper at $.99 and most of our non-movie items at $.99 as well! Bid on all you want and, as long as it fits in one package, pay only one shipping fee (non-US orders pay actual shipping)! Follow this link to visit our About Me Page for more details on why we are your best choice for eBay purchases Note that sometimes it is difficult to get a good image of an item. Some images may have glare but the glare is NOT part of the actual item."}, {"ItemID": "1494889970", "Name": "CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN Oscar Ad", "Category": ["Movies & Television", "Memorabilia", "Movie", "Ads, Flyers"], "Currently": "$5.99", "First_Bid": "$5.99", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "San Francisco", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-08-01 17:44:54", "Ends": "Dec-11-01 17:44:54", "Seller": {"UserID": "mdecapite@earthlink.net", "Rating": "390"}, "Description": "This auction is for the new CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN industry trade ad promoting the film for Oscar Consideration.

Nice 8 X 10 B&W glossy photo of actress JANET MUNRO in shorts and halter top. British actress Janet Munro was the daughter of a stage comedian who, during World War 2, was in charge of the RAF entertainment unit. Janet's popular on British TV of the 1950s was such that one prominent fan magazine, responding to public demand, voted her \"Miss Television of 1958\". Signed by Disney in 1959, Janet played spirited ingenue roles in Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), Third Man on the Mountain (1959), Swiss Family Robinson (1960) and The Horsemasters (released to American television in 1961 and to European theatres shortly thereafter). Once away from the Disney orbit, Janet radically altered her screen image with a string of sexy, fallen-woman roles; her final film assignment was as the fading alcoholic pop star in Sebastian (1968). Her success in show business was in sharp contrast to her extraordinarily unhappy private life, which included two failed marriages to actors Tony Wright and Ian Hendry and two miscarriages. Janet Munro collapsed and died at age 38, reportedly choking to death while drinking tea. The official cause of death is listed as acute myocarditis. _ Hal Erickson PLEASE READ: I do not utilize at this time the optional \"checking out\" feature displayed on my item description page by EBAY.

Arming soldiers and officers as a self-defense weapon in the Pacific and in Europe, the .45 1911-A1 model passed the battlefield \"tests\" with flying colors. Some 7 years after the war had ended; the U.S. military brass considered the .45 cartridge an effective round but that the full-sized Government model that fired it was too large for officers and others of high rank to easily carry. Keeping the caliber and capacity, the model 1911-A1 was shortened by 5/8 of an inch, manufactured with lighter alloys and named after the personnel it was designed for, the Commander appeared and was praised. This high quality model has authentic details and is built to 1:1 scale. Working slide, trigger, magazine and release. There is a full-length slide travel on this replica. Realistic removable magazine. Open combat sights. Color is black, and the finish appears as the genuine article. Length is about 8 inches. Pistol comes NEW, mint in box with instructions, and removable full size clip. The 1911-A1 Commander is one of the most realistic and most detailed replicas available. In fact, many movies and TV Series actually use guns such as these as back up and throw down pieces because of their detail and inexpensive nature. Why destroy a $500 steel blank firing prop when you can have the same amount of detail at well less than half the cost? This replica is composed of tough ABS polymer and metal parts. Because of the 1911-A1 Commander _s realistic appearance we don't recommend carrying this item in public. Sold for display or film and theatrical prop purposes only!

This friendly, go-for-broke sequel to 1997's Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery finds our man Austin heading back to the '60s to keep perennial nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers again) from blowing up the world--and, more importantly, to get back his mojo, that man-juice that turns Austin into irresistible catnip for women, especially American spygirl Felicity Shagwell (a pretty but vacant Heather Graham). The plot may be irreverent and illogical, the jokes may be bad (with characters named Ivana Humpalot and Robin Swallows, n_e Spitz), and the scenes may run on too long, but it's all delivered sunnily and with tongue firmly in cheek. Myers's true triumph, though, is his turn as the neurotic Dr. Evil, who tends to spout the right cultural reference at exactly the wrong time (referring to his moon base as a \"Death Star\" with Moon Units Alpha and Zappa--in 1969). Myers teams Dr. Evil with a diminutive clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), who soon replaces slacker son Scott Evil (Seth Green) as the apple of the doctor's eye; Myers and Troyer work magic in what could plausibly be one of the year's most affecting (and hysterically funny) love stories. Despite a stellar supporting cast--including a sly Rob Lowe as Robert Wagner's younger self and Mindy Sterling as the forbidding Frau Farbissina--it's basically Myers's show, and he pulls a hat trick by playing a third character, the obese and disgusting Scottish assassin Fat Bastard. Many viewers will reel in disgust at Mr. Bastard's repulsive antics and the scatological bent Myers indulges in, including one showstopper involving coffee and--shudder--a stool sample. Still, Myers's good humor and dead-on cultural references win the day; Austin is one spy who proves he can still shag like a minx.

These ads are very carefully removed from various publications, both domestic and international, and carefully shipped to you. They are published in a variety of sizes (note description), and on various paper stocks from heavyweight card stock to glossy magazine paper stock to color newsprint. These ads have become highly sought after by collectors primarily due to the unique artwork utilized by the ad's promoter. These ads often are created for limited distribution, sometimes running only on a single occasion, so generally unique and dynamic artwork is created--artwork that stands apart from that used in traditional consumer-retail campaigns. They are most often framed or matted by collectors, or sometimes stored in scrapbooks. Once these collectibles are framed or matted, particularly the 11\" x 14\" variety, they are often mistaken for mini-posters. Multi-page ads vary from ad to ad. Some multi-page ads are conjoined while some are separate pages. Please inquire if this is important to you.

Splendid 8 X 10 B&W glossy photo of stunning beauty CAROLE LOMBARD. Carole Lombard was born Jane Alice Peters in Fort Wayne, Indiana on October 6, 1908. Her parents divorced in 1916 and Carole's mother took the family on a trip out West. While there they decided to settle down in the Los Angeles area in California. After being spotted playing baseball in the street with the neighborhood boys by a film director, Carole was signed to a one picture contract in 1921 when she was 12. The film in question was A PERFECT CRIME. Although she tried for other acting jobs, she would not be seen again for four years. For the time being she returned to a normal life, going to school and participating in athletics at which she was very good particularly track and field. At 15, Carole had had enough of school and quit. She joined a theater troupe and played in several stage shows, which were for the most part nothing to write home about. In 1925, she passed a screen test and was signed to a contract with 20th Century Fox. Her first role as a Fox player was HEARTS AND SPURS where she had the lead. Right after that film Carole appeared in a western called DURAND OF THE BADLANDS. She rounded out 1925 in the comedy MARRIAGE IN TRANSIT. Other films that year included a number of shorts. In 1926, Carole was seriously injured in an automobile accident which left the left side of her face scarred. Once she had recovered, Fox canceled her contract. She did find work in a number of shorts during 1928 (thirteen of them), but did go back for a one time shot with Fox called ME, GANGSTER. By now, the film industry was moving from the silent era to \"talkies\". While some had their careers end due to sound, Carole made a very smooth transition. Her first film with sound was HIGH VOLTAGE with Pathe (her new studio employer) in 1929. In 1931, Carole was teamed with William Powell in MAN OF THE WORLD. (In fact, she married Powell, but the union was a failure with a divorce in 1933). NO MAN OF HER OWN (1932) put Carole opposite Clark Gable for the first and only time. (They married in seven years later in 1939). By now she was with Paramount Studios and was one of their top stars. But it was 1934's TWENTIETH CENTURY that showed her true comedic talents and proved to the world what a fine actress she really was. In 1936, Carole received her only Oscar nomination for Best Actress in MY MAN GODFREY. As Irene Bullock, she was superb in the role. Unfortunately, the coveted award went to Luise Ranier in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD which also won for Best Picture. She was now working about one film a year at her choosing, because she wanted any role she picked to be a good one. She was very adept at picking just the right part. And why not? She was smart enough to see through the good-ol-boy syndrome of the studio moguls. She commanded and received one of the top salaries in the business. At one time it was reported she was making $35, 000 a week. She made but one film in 1941, that being MR. & MRS. SMITH. Her last film was in 1942, when Carole played Maria Tura in TO BE OR NOT TO BE. She did not live to see its release. Finished in 1941 at the time the US entered World War II, Carole went home to Indiana for a war bond rally. On January 16, 1942, Carole, her mother, and 20 other people were flying back to California when the plane went down outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. All perished. The highly acclaimed comedy actress was dead at the age of 33 and few have been able to match her talents since.

Since the unfortunate events of September 11th, 2001 I have had trouble with International mail. Some items have been returned to me, while others have never arrived. I have also had trouble receiving payment from abroad. It seems to be taking longer than we like. As a result International payments must be made via Bidpay.com or I cannot be held accountable if your payment never arrives. I chose Bidpay.com because I do not need to join them or give them any confidential information to use their services. Sorry Paypal fans. Further I cannot be responsible for uninsured or unregistered mail. Please bear this in mind before placing a bid. Thanks for understanding. Priority Mail shipping within The Contiguous United States is $3.50. If you want cheaper shipping, or are elsewhere, please check USPS.gov { that's a link } and look for the rate calculator. Figure a 1 pound package coming from zip code 08030. International bidders are urged to click on This Link , enter their country and the weight of the package, and preview their postage costs. I prefer Postal Money orders because they are federally guaranteed to not bounce, but will accept any money order, personal check, casheirs check, or gold bullion... I have noticed a marked drop in picture quality online versus the actual photo. If you like, you can Email me & I'll send you a copy of the file. It should provide better resolution. International Bidders (and incontinental US bidders) are requested to identify themselves via Email prior to bidding. This is simply so I do not misquote shipping costs to you. If you have any questions; please Email me, or else you'll never know the answers (my name is my Email address). _ _ Low cost image hosting and full service auction management solutions: AuctionWatch Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

Though I wasn't around during the Drive-In's heyday I got to see my fair share of them in the late 1970's. In fact years earlier I saw my first \"on screen\" booby at a Drive-In. As a kid coming home from a family restaurant we always passed this run down Drive-In, and every time we would pass it at night I would gaze with anticipation to see something- ANYTHING I wasn't supposed too see! Well one evening IT happend, as my dear father speed by the tattered and torn Drive-In I careened my head out the window, strained my eyes and there it was, in all of its glory a 5 story high boob- JACKPOT!!! Too this day I still have no idea what movie was playing but that awesome childhood memory (or should that be mammoire!) I hold dear in my heart to this day! Oh yes the DRIVE-INs, I love everything about them, from the bad speaker sound the loud drunks yelling stiff at the enormous screen, the laughter of the children playing in the mini-playground, the young lovers steamed up windows and the Concession stands tasty steamed Hot Dogs and Popcorn that was so greasy you were guaranteed a face full of pimples in the morning! Sadly the Drive-In days are pretty much over and a full resurgence too its 1950's heyday is little more than wishful thinking! But we all can dream can't we? So here I introduce you too the coolest line of shirts I've ever seen! Yes, an actual *New* Drive-In Movie Theater Work Shirt! These really have to seen to be believed! They are exactly what you would have worn if YOU were an employee of the \"Starlight Drive-In\" in Baltimore, Maryland (home of John Waters!). This is a NEW and NEVER BEEN WORN employee button-up, collared work shirt! Screen printed over the right side pocket is the AWSOME \"Starlight Drive-In\" logo, complete with Baltimore, Maryland printed below! Now on the right hand sleeve is an advertisement for the Starlight_s Weekly Special- a little theater cartoon man screams: \"REMEMBER! $2 Car Loads Every Tuesday!\" This was a common practice by Drive-In's all across the country to entice you and as many of your friends you can CRAM in your moms_ car (we could 5 people in the trunk!) to come to the theater during the weekdays! Now my FAVORITE part of the shirt, screen-printed on the left-hand sleeve is the theater advertisement for the Concession Stand! It reads _Visit our CONCESSION STAND! Ice-Cold Drinks, Fresh Popcorn, Delicious Hot Dogs_- complete with little illustrations of Dancing Food, much like you'd see in the INTERMISION cartoon the theater would run during the middle of the movie! Below these characters it reads: \"It's Always A Good Time for a Treat!\" Oh yes, truer words have never been spoken! Now on the back of this particular shirt is an advertisement for the \"The Last House on the Left.\" Can a Drive-In work shirt go too far? The back of this \"Killer\" Starlight Drive-In employee work shirt is an ad for the ground breaking Wes Craven rape/revenge film \"Last House on the Last\". Wes (an ex-high school teacher!) directed this exploitation clasSICK in 1972, and it contains scenes so sick, shocking, and vile that they hold their own to any modern day splatter flick! After viewing this film you just feel dirty and have the urge to take a shower- only a handful of movies ever made can spawn this weird feeling! This Drive-In employee work shirt features the three movie villains lustfully eyeing over a knife blade that is dripping wet with fresh blood! Oooooh sounds yummy, don't it! Surrounding this disturbing image is the now famous movie hype that many an exploitation film has used since. Now I warn you, this is a very disturbing shirt, to avoid fainting keep repeating, \"It's only a Work Shirt, It's only a Work Shirt, It's only a Work Shirt _. This work shirt has an awesome vintage Drive-In feel to it and would be a great addition to any film poster, horror collector or Drive-In enthusiasts wardrobe! Bid on this or just _Buy it Now_ because I know your just _craven_ to own it! This is size XLarge and it is BRAND NEW and HAS NEVER BEEN WORN! It is collared with buttons up the front and has two front pockets! High bidder pays $4.50 Priority shipping (international rates more-email me). I'll ship the shirt out within 7-10 days (usually faster) after payment is received if paid for by a cert. check or money order-all other checks must clear (held for 10 Days) before you can start working at this Drive-In!
