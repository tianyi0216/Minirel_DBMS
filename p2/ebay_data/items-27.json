They are burgundy, browns, olive green, navy blue, and cream. Each suitcase, etc. is very detailed in color. Some of the suitcases come with 3-D gold buckles on them. The front carry-on (3rd picture) is actually a pocket, the flap has a snap to close it. The buttons are gold suitcases (2nd picture). There is too much to mention. You won't be disappointed. It is a size medium or measures 28 inches from shoulder seam to bottom and 42 around. It is in excellent shape. This would make a great Christmas present for yourself or someone you love!

This glorious coat was purchased from the estate of Barbara Dunne here in Cincinnati. Barbara was Miss Cincinnati in 1947, and went on to be a super model in New York. This was made for her for a photo shoot, there are no labels of the furrier in the lining, just her initials (from another marriage) and embroidering on both sides. I would say the vintage because of the style is late 1950's to early 1960's. This could of only been worn a few times, it is in like new condition.. The velvet lined hood feels soooo luxurious on and has a hidden snap for when you just want to use it as a collar. This cape will fit a size 9-10 on down to a 7-8, with minimum height of 5'4\" tall...Thats me.....From the back at the bottom of the hood seam to the bottom it measures 48\" long. The very dramatic sweep measures 81\", the hood stands another 14\" and is 9\" wide. There are two hidden slits for your arms, with the inner straps in the lining, and one hook on the folded down color, which when latched will cover the entire neckline, I show it open..... In Pristine condition, Barbara had a \"Vault\" in New York where she kept her many furs. In the photos there shows some white, this was very hard to photograph. There are absolutely no bare spots or drying to the fur. It is as if it were brand new....Better...they don't make anything like this now in mink. Capes are very big this year, along with fur. This is one of a kind. This Russian Black Mink is of high quality, with barely a hint of brown to it, so well made you can't tell where one pelt ends and another starts. It appears to be one large piece...And unlike most \" black minks\" it is not dyed.. This takes your breath away, and the fur simply glows....

PAYMENT OPTIONS: PayPal, Billpoint (credit card or electronic check), money order or cashier's check within 7 days of auction close. Sorry, NO PERSONAL CHECKS.

Please click here to visit my little gallery of new and gently worn upscale clothes, shoes, and bags. Now for the fine print: Please do not bid if you have just filed bankrupty, have deadbeat bidder feedback, or if you will be making like an elf at the North Pole, surfing the big one at North Beach, ice fishing in Greenland, solo sailing the Atlantic, climbing Everest, manning the space station, or otherwise gone missing when the auction ends! I reserve the right to reject bidders with nasty feedback and anyone I know as untrustworthy or rude. Sale is final unless I made an awful mess of the description, so please ask questions if you need more info. I'll answer honestly and as quickly as possible, but kindly allow 24 hours for a response, as I don't have the luxury of doing this for a living! I take care to describe all items as accurately as possible, but please understand that I do not manufacture or design any of the items I am selling; I do not weave the fabrics, dye the leather, or have a selection of sizes or colors. Many expensive fabrics, especially the natural ones like silk and leather, have small, natural irregularities in weave and texture (darn those silk worms, anyway!) Please know the difference between these and flaws like rips and holes before you bid. If eBay crashes within two hours of auction's end, I reserve the option to scratch all bids and start over again, or accept the high bid. Serious bidders can stop reading now: If high bidder has not surfaced within 3 days of auction end and/or does not deliver payment in 7 days, I will relist the item and the bidder earns bad Karma, a non-paying bidder notification at eBay, and some of that negative feedback I really hate to write!

If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas.

It has a full leotard made of stretchy fabric that measures about 23_ from the shoulder to the inseam. The white collar joins in the back above a keyhole opening. It has no fasteners since pins are used to size it just right for the recital, but they could easily be added to fit your child. It has white sleeves and a white _vee_ in the front that gives it the appearance of a red vest. The _vest_ front is covered with red sequins, bordered with silver sequins and has a red sequined bow-tie and three large silver sequins sewn on to look like _buttons._ The separate, elastic-waisted skirt is covered with red sequins and bordered at the bottom with silver sequins. The skirt is about 10_ from top to bottom. My daughter wore this outfit only twice, for a dress rehearsal and a dance recital. It is well made and could be used as a jazz/tap, skating or cheerleading costume, or would make a wonderful \"dress up\" outfit.

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20.
