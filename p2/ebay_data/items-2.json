I do not collect trivets, so any information I include here is only what was passed to me, as I can not claim any personal expertise in the area. This cast iron trivet is a nice match to another one of my listings with a single turtledove. This trivet has a heart handle with an iron stand shaped plate. The main body has a two headed turtle dove with a heart shaped body, flanked by two more hearts. It has been painted with PA Dutch / Amish styled accent colors of blue, green, red and yellow. Measures 8 1/4\" x 4\". Rear markings: \"260\". Revision... I was calling this bird a turtledove until I received an email from a friendly eBayer (thanks lenka!) informing me that this is not a turtledove, but rather the \"Mystical Distelfink with two heads so he is better able to watch more closely for evil to ward off and keep away from the distelfinks care giver. The farmer would also paint this bird on his barns to keep it and it's contents safe.\" That info got me curious and on the web site www.amishmarket.com, I found this description of a hex sign with a similar design: \"Double Eagle (Courage) A large, stylized double headed bird, a double headed eagle, is shown in this design. The eagle represents strength and courage. The trinity tulips add faith, hope and charity; the heart add love. This design symbolizes strength and courage.\" This trivet doesn't have the trinity tulip, but it does have the hearts, and the bird looks like the double headed eagle shown on the hex sign. So, it looks like it's not a turtledove afterall, but either an Eagle or a Distelfink (goldfinch)!

This old mold is in remarkable condition considering it's age. It doesn't look like it was ever used. On the inside of the mold, there was an old recipe card for \"Coconut Lamb Cake\". The interesting thing is that most of the brands the recipe calls for are either no longer being made or are very old famous well used brands. For instance, \"Swans Down Cake Flour, Snow Frosting, and Calumet Baking Powder.\" The recipe card is dated 1921. The lamb mold measures 13 and 1/2\" in length by 8\" in height. This old mold looks as if it was a promotional item for The General Foods Corporation in the 1920's promoting Bakers Coconut. The mold also has \"Baker's Coconut\" embossed at the bottom beneath the Lamb. This is a great old piece of advertising, not to mention a wonderful collectible for the culinary person! This old Lamb mold would also just be a fabulous piece to display in a country kitchen. You also have the original old recipe card that came with the mold, so there's no excuse not to put this old mold to use!! Best of all NO RESERVE . Personal checks or money orders accepted. Checks must clear before shipping. We can accept Visa and MasterCard, but only via PayPal. All items sold as is, so please be sure to ask any questions before you bid.

Welcome to my auctions for this week! Yup...it's the original. Hulk #4, a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby classic! This is a Good/Good+ copy. It's got lots of wear, but is still a solid copy. Both staples are still well attached, as is the centerfold. The book has a slight spine roll. The best part about this book is that the pages are supple and a GORGEOUS and SOLID off-white, as are the inside front covers! There is NO sign of color unevenness at all! Nice! This is part of a large collection I bought a while back from Showcase-New-England, and this is what they graded it, I agree, so you can be doubly sure of grading! Overstreet Guide for this book is $140.00 H A P P Y H O L I D A Y S ! The Holidays are upon us! This is an EXCELLENT gift for the comic collector you know and love, or even yourself ! ALL items PAID FOR by December 17th are GUARANTEED to ship in time for Christmas if shipped Priority! Cool, huh? GRADING: I've been collecting and selling for over 11 years...I care about comics, and condition, and I grade according to Overstreet and CGC standards. I grade strictly because I know what it's like to spend good money on a book that I REALLY wanted, only to be really disappointed when it shows up two grades lower than advertised. So, please bid with confidence! SHIPPING: Shipping will be $4.50 (isn't that crazy?) for USPS Priority Mail, or $2.50 Special Standard (Book Rate). Price includes Delivery Confirmation for both, and insurance can also be purchased. All books are shipped in sturdy packages...no point in selling nice books, and then having them damaged in shipping! And always, shipping is combined for multiple auction wins. International Bidders : I will ship the books anywhere in the world, but it gets SPENDY! I try to ship everything via Global Priority ($9US to most countries), but please note, there may be exchange and bank fees involved. I'm not making extra money, just passing on what I get charged. PAYMENT: Please DO NOT PAY until I have contacted you! This is very important, as it has led to some confusion in the past. Thank you! Hey, check out my other auctions here: Grayson's Auctions! Enjoy! The Small Print: 1. I answer ALL e-mail questions as soon as I receive them, so please do not hesitate to ask! 2. Winning bidder notifications will be sent out within 24 hours of auction's end. PLEASE READ the entire note, and pay attention to all details therein. I cannot tell you how many times I've received payments with absolutely NO identification as to what it's for, and then folks get mad when their shipment is delayed! 3. I have had an inordinate amount of non-paying bidders lately. I'm a decent and honest person, but even I get frustrated when people take advantage of me. So please, if you're not going to pay, for whatever reason, please just don't bid. If something happens in between the auction's end, and you sending payment, please do not wait for ME to contact YOU. Communication is the KEY, and usually resolves problems! 4. I can only ship once a week, as I cannot get to the Post Office more than that. Please be patient when expecting your book(s)! 5. If, after you receive your item(s), you're not happy for ANY reason...please let me know! I have zero negatives because I take care of my customers. We can work out a solution that works for everyone, if it comes to that. My focus is the COLLECTOR looking for specific items, not dealers, or other wholesalers. I want everyone to be not just satisfied, but HAPPY with what they purchase! Happy customers are repeat customers! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

It is pictured with the antique green and I could email you a photo of it with a gold Tell City item. Unfortunately, I do not have any red or blue finishes to photo it with. I seasonally change the upholstery on the Tell City upholstered chairs and cushioned rockers for variety. My local upholstery lady has adapted velcro to enable easy change out of the skirts.

All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Buyer to pay $4.50 for shipping and handling. All international bidders MUST email us for an adjusted S&H quote! . Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

Winner pays shipping. Most items have fixed shipping in the listing ad. I ship Priority Mail unless otherwise stated. Envelope items with 1st class shipping do not include insurance and by accepting this method of shipping you are taking the risk of it being lost in the mail. Rare, but it can & has happened.

Please read the description. I make every effort to fully disclose all flaws in a short description. Vintage items are sold in the same condition I buy them. Due to nerve damage in my right hand & arm, I cannot wash every item because I loose control. We pack every item VERY carefully, but occasionally breakage happens anyway, and the buyer is responsible for filing and collecting the insurance claim per the rules of the Postal Service. Sellers put a lot of time and money into having these auctions available for your consideration. Please be kind, only bid if you intend to follow through. As with many sellers, this is my only source of income and I depend on you honoring your bid. If I can help someone out by the use of any of my auction pictures, please feel free to use them.

The tablecloth is 75 inches x 61 inches in size. I have no idea what kind of fabric the tablecloth is made from although I believe it is cotton or a cotton blend. You can see the texture of the fabric as it is not a fine weave fabric. The deep rich color of the fabric adds to the luxurious quality of this tablecloth. I am pretty sure the fabric is not permanent press as it does crease fairly easily. This beautiful tablecloth belonged to my Mother in Law. I have no idea how old it is. I believe she used it under her lace tablecloths (separate auctions) for added color. I am no expert. However, from what I can see, the tablecloth is in mint condition.

These spoons are very fragile due to the thin neck and prone to breakage - this one is in excellent condtion. Marked on the bottom: c1958 Holt Howard Japan with the Original H/H Japan foil label too!

Piece has overall crazing as can be expected with these. This item is as close to mint as they come. The only reason why I didn't call it mint is due to the crazing. However as I said most all of these Pixie's have crazing so you be the judge. Shipping: Safe, secure, professional shipping $9.00 to USA & Canada - Insurance optional/extra.

In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

So far, it_s been my experience that it_s not quite perfected. Unless you_ve used it and are delighted with it, please don_t click on checkout. When you click on it I get an email instructing me to send you an invoice. I_ve had several double payments as bidders think they must pay from it after they_ve already sent payment via paypal. Paypal is by far my favorite but Billpoint is also accepted. I_ll send an email when the auction finishes _ usually within the hour. On with the listing_. Today I'm listing vintage textiles. Most of these were purchased at estate auctions. Because of that, I have no accurate idea of the age. Unless stated otherwise, you can expect them to be used and possibly stained. I'll do my absolute best to describe stains and any damage. Any piece that shows more than 2 or 3 small holes goes into the _cutter_ pile and will be listed as such. It's never my intention to misrepresent an item. Textiles are so difficult to list because, I know as a buyer myself, they are nice to feel before buying. Also, any round white spots are probably camera lens spots. I_ll be happy to combine multiple wins to save on shipping costs. This tablecloth measures 56 x 76 inches. It has no staining - no holes. (We think the yellow napkins match - see my listing of dozens of napkins.) The color is a soft buttery yellow. If the cloth is turned upside down it's more like the napkins. I start all listings at $1.00 _ if possible. I know half of the fun of eBay is bidding (the other half is winning!). Email any questions before bidding. I reserve the right to reject bids from anyone with negative feedback regarding payment. Payment is requested within 10 days of the close of the auction _ please do not bid if you have no intention to buy. Iowa residents add 7% sales tax. Methods of payment accepted are money orders, credit cards using Paypal.com & Billpoint, and I will accept personal checks _ if you have at least 10 positive payment feedbacks. High bidder to add $5.20 toward shipping (international bidders see next paragraph). This amount does NOT include insurance _ I_m trying to keep your costs down. Insurance can be requested on any auction ($1.10 for the first $50 of value). I am not responsible for uninsured items or items that the post office loses. I pack as carefully as possible but accidents can occur. I am disappointed when something I order breaks and know that you are too. I_ve been shipping items for over a year and Priority Mail is the most cost effective method. Other arrangements can be made by request - especially on books and paper items. I try to watch for those winning multiple auctions and will combine for shipping savings. I mail Monday through Friday and your package will go out the next trip after payment is received _ I will email you confirming this. Because of ongoing difficulties with the Sioux City UPS customer counter I can only UPS parcels via Mail Boxes Etc. If you are an international bidder (this includes Canadians) you will need to send me your postal code and I will get you a shipping amount (for surface and air) at that time. I will not sign a customs form declaring the contents are a gift. I must let you know that the US Postal Service has discontinued the small packet rate. Shipping has drastically increased _ even to Canada. What I thought would cost $4 to ship was increased to $14. If payment is not received the following feedback will be left _ _as promised _ negative feedback due to nonpaying bidder_. I was kind last year and burned a few times. If your payment will be delayed, please let me know - I understand things do happen. Thanks for taking the time to look and check out my other auctions for similar items!

Justman! Profiles in History's Once in a Lifetime Experiences presents Dinner with Robert. H. Justman! What Star Trek fan wouldn't jump at the chance to spend an evening with one of the most beloved figures in Star Trek History? One very fortunate bidder will have that chance. The esteemed Mr. Justman needs no introduction to Star Trek fans, but here is an opportunity to spend a private evening with a true gentleman, a charming conversationalist, a genuine insider and a font of Star Trek knowledge, at one of the most \"in\" spots in LA - the famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant - Spago's Beverly Hills If you are the high bidder, you and a guest will be flown to Los Angeles where your personal Towncar awaits you. You will glide in luxury up the famous 405 freeway and down Sunset Boulevard, through Beverly Hills and into the heart of Hollywood, where your room at the grand old historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has been reserved. This is the true Grande Dame of Hollywood - the site of the first Academy Awards Presentation and the glamorous gathering place of the biggest stars in Motion Picture History. Here, you will have time to relax, and freshen up before you meet Mr. Justman and his gracious, elegant wife for dinner. Your Towncar will drive you to Spago's where the food is the exquisite and the clientele exclusive. This is a unique and very limited opportunity to ask the questions you've always wanted to ask, discuss the subjects you want to discuss - and experience the luxury of a private dinner with a Star Trek legend. Of course Jamie Lee Curtis or Billy Crystal just might be at the next table. But you'll probably be so engrossed in Mr. Justman's tales and anecdotes (not only of Star Trek but his many, many other shows) that you won't even notice. When your dinner is over - your Towncar awaits to return you to your hotel, or to explore LA Nightlife on your own. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is across from the Chinese Theater, convenient to Universal Studios, the Sunset Strip, and other major attractions, and only one block from the brand new entertainment & shopping Complex, Hollywood and Highland! Be the first to go where no fan has gone before - into the private life of this distinguished and beloved repository of Star Trek lore. This item is one of more than 500 pieces of Star Trek memorabilia, all from the collection of Star Trek Art Director Matt Jefferies, Executive in Charge of Production Herb Solow and Producer Bob Justman. Our highlight items - over 300 - will be auctioned off live on December 12, 2001 at 2:00 pm PST.
