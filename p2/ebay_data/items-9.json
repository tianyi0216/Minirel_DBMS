I built up a 550+ feedback rating while working with Socko! Comics. Now I am starting over on my own, but that means starting with a feedback of zero. Read my Honesty Policy below. 1966 VF DC TEEN TITANS #1 - 4 QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER & PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don't like it when people do it to me, so I won't do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 Front #1 Back #3 Front #3 Back #4 Front #4 Back HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put, it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover, back cover, corners, edges, spine & staples, interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also, I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page, I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction's end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book, then ask for a return if they decided they didn't want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don't bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come fromt he same collection and have received the same tender care over the years.

When Keith Giffen revamped the dying Legion of Super-Heroes title by aging the characters and ditching those funny looking colorful leotards...he hit an audience that was ready for some sophisticated, yet humorous storylines. But there were a great deal of people who missed the young innocence that the title used to have. So how do you appease both sets of fans? Simple, you have an evil alien race, the Dominion, clone the Legionnaires and incubate them for use as weapons in their plans to invade Earth. But the Legion of Substitute Heroes liberates the clones (who conveniently have incubated to the age they were when they first met Superboy) and both sets of Legionnaires band together to defeat the Dominion. But what do you do now, with two sets of most of your favorite Legionnaires? Again, simple...you give the young clones their own title. Written by Tom & Mary Bierbaum and drawn by Chris Sprouse. I am not a professional grader, so the best way to describe the books are that they're readers copies in pretty decent shape. And don't go knocking the value of a readers copy book. Let's say you're not a collector but you missed the comics of yesteryear, when comics really meant something, and you'd like to relive a little of that magic without having to spend a fortune. Readers copies are the way to go. Now, let's say you are a collector and go through the meticulous process of keeping your comics preserved. If you ever get nostalgic and decide to crack open one of those mylar bags (or whatever protection you use), you run the risk of damaging your precious books. Readers copies allow you to read without fear. Readers Copies. An inexpensive way to explore the valuable history of comics.

EASY CARD TO WALLET Here is a great easy to perform \"Card to Wallet\" routine. I have personally been using this method for over 4 years with much success! There are many ways to get a spectator's signed card to a wallet. Most of the routines for this effect involve palming a card in some way. The beauty of this routine is that although palming is not needed, the end result appears the same to the spectator. This routine is so easy; you may actually feel guilty when you use it! You will blow your audiences away with this very strong routine. GAFF VARIETY PACKET! How many times have you needed a certain gaffed card for an effect and didn't have it? Sometimes it's even hard to locate certain gaffed cards. When you finally locate the gaffed cards, they usually cost upwards of fifty cents apiece or more! Well, you're in luck. I've done the footwork, and taken the hassle out of locating the most needed gaffed cards! All these gaffed cards are poker sized \"Bicycle\" stock. You will get 3 cards of each gaff. You get a total of 21 gaffed cards! Here is what you get In my variety pack: 3-Double backed red cards. 3-Double backed blue cards. 3-Two color double-backed cards (1 side red & 1 side blue). 3-Double blank face cards. 3-Double face cards. 3-Blank face red back cards. 3-Blank face blue back cards Don't pass up this great offer. I don't think you can get a variety pack like this without actually investing in at least one deck of each gaff. You will eventually need these cards for something you will want to work on. When you do_you will have them! This variety pack will cost much, much less than you would pay in stores. I hope you can appreciate the value offered here!

The grades you see are extremely accurate. (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan\"Slightly better than appeared on the scan. A+\" -nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase;\". Better than described. A+++++ THANKS \";OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said\"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist( often similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to white paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid. As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1950 up.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition.(Note; on some multiscan auctions we are not able to offer the buy it now feature) We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel and DC inventory is extensive and often stocked in multiple conditions form the 1950's up...Note.All our scans are \"High resolution\".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?

I have (I hope) gotten the automated Billpoint invoice system working on MOST of my auctions, but I have a feeling there will be some glitches for a while!! _ What I'm trying to do, is make it easy for you to see your total after the auction ends. You can get it: 1.) on the actual auction page itself, 2.) off a \"Winning Bidder Email\" sent after the auction ends that will supply a link to a check out if you prefer to take that route. My address is noted there. I May just send you you all the info if I'm really feeling gung hoat the moment! _ Okay, phew! Just so you know, I use Brand New top of the line packing materials. Fresh foam roll and thick craft paper. No used newspaper or funky boxes picked out of trash cans here! On all multiple orders, or item/s OVER 5.1 pounds they will go UPS to save you money as USPS can be outrageously expensive! I want you _ HAPPY _ I have up to 100 auctions going on at once, I'm pregnant, (Emily Katherine, due March 7th) have a wild 2 year old boy Christopher, 3 dogs, 2 cats, and a high maintenance husband so please notify me within 3 days of auctions end of how you will be paying and your address, so I can be more efficient and not go completely nuts! I'm getting a little slower packing as I have to pace myself lately, so if you are dying to get your package, and I mean tomorrow.._.., please let me know so I can work with you~! On the watches, I keep a number of every design in stock, but I can't predict how crazy things are going to get with the demand so it may take 1 to 14 days to get those in the mail depending on my stock. So if you are bidding on a watch and are concerned about when it will get in the mail to you - just ask. I'll let you know the time frame. Again, Per Ebay rules and proper etiquette I might add, I need to be contacted by you within 3 days of auction end. Payment within 10 days. I don't want to be forced to get the ebay fees back through filing a non paying bidder form! (Yuk)If you are going on vacation etc., please tell me that before hand. Positive feedback will be left IMMEDIATELY upon receipt of payment/clearance of check. Thanks for reading this all, most people don't so good for you!!! _ Hope this has helped and GOD BLESS AMERICA! _ This seller is an Auction Professional.

The hallmark is worn, but it could say MARGOLIN. The bag is has a large carrying capacity. The interior of the purse has a goldtone framed purse, with a flipup clasp. The interior of the purse is lined in black twill and has a gold twill slip pocket. On each side of the center purse are twill lined open compartments, each having their own side zippered pocket. The looped leather strap can pull through and be used as one shoulderstrap, or each end can pull together for a handstrap. There are also four goldtone metal grommets on the bottom. For it's age, this bag is in pretty good shape. The strap itself has some wear and a bit of loose stitching - otherwise the leather is still soft and supple and the interior is great! Make a statement with this nice bag! Dimensions are 12.5\"L, 10\"H, 3.50\"W. Shipping is through U.S. Postal Service with Delivery Confirmation. See shipping cost below.
