This is a must have for your video library. The Tape and Original Cover are in EXCELLENT condition. \"This powerfully majestic film tells the story of a man obsessed building an opera house in the middle of the Peruvian jungle. In order to fund the project, he conceives the idea of pulling a steamboat over a mountain and into a river tributary where he can achieve a monopoly in the rubber trading business. Director Werner Herzog returns to the exotic locales and obsessive themes of previous works in his Amazon masterpiece, FITZCARRALDO. Klaus Kinski gives a terrifying and determined portrayal of mad genius Fitzcarraldo, whose twin goals of making a fortune off the Amazon rubber trade and bringing an opera house to the jungle give the film its crushing centerpiece--the maniacal leader_s Sisyphean efforts at hauling a gigantic steamship over a mountain bank. The single-minded and wickedly energetic Fitzcarraldo moves mountains (and a boat) with his will and along the way acts out a stunning and emotional battle between man and nature, as in the similarly themed Herzog/Kinski collaboration AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD. Herzog_s razor-sharp attention to the minutiae of both Fitzcarraldo_s madness and the jungle_s corresponding apathy and enormity makes the film a breathtaking metaphor for civilization_s impact on the natural world. The documentary style of the film (the cast and crew actually hauled the boat over the mountain) gives the tale an urgency and suspense that, combined with Kinski_s bravado performance and Herzog_s striking sense of landscape, make FITZCARRALDO an unforgettable experience.\" I will accept Money Orders, and Mastercard/Visa through PAYPAL.

John Carpenter's 3-Pack: Vampires / Christine / Starman Vampires: In the blood-chilling tradition of Halloween and Village of the Damned comes John Carpenter's unique vision of the ultimate killing machines, Vampires. \"Forget everything you've ever known about vampires,\" warns Jack Crow (James Woods), the leader of Team Crow, a relentless group of mercenary vampire slayers. When Master Vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) decimates Jack's entire team, Crow and the sole team survivor, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), set out in pursuit. Breaking all the rules, Crow and Montoya take one of Valek's victims hostage. The beautiful but unlucky prostitute (Sheryl Lee) is their sole psychic link to Valek, and through her senses they will track down the leader of the undead. As Valek nears the climax of his 600-year search for the Berziers Cross, Jack and the new Team Crow do everything humanly possible to prevent him from possessing the only thing that can grant him and all vampires the omnipotent power to walk in the daylight. Christine: She was born in Detroit. on an automobile assembly line. But she is no ordinary automobile. Deep within her chassis lies an unholy presence. She is Christine - a red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury whose unique standard equipment includes an evil, indestructible vengeance that will destroy anyone in her way. She seduces 17-year-old Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who becomes consumed with passion for her sleek, rounded, chrome-laden body. She demands his complete and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become the victims of Christine's horrifying wrath. John Carpenter brings Stephen King's best-selling novel to life in this chilling thriller. Starman: Director John Carpenter presents a romantic science fiction odyssey starring Jeff Bridges as an innocent alien from a distant planet who learns what it means to be a man in love. When his spacecraft is shot down over Wisconsin, Starma (Bridges) arrives at the remote cabin of a distraught young widow, Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen), and clones the form of her dead husband. The alien convinces Jenny to drive him to Arizona, explaining that if he isn't picked up by his mothership in three days, he'll die. Hot on their trail are government agents, intent on capturing the alien, dead or alive. En route, Starman demonstrates the power of universal love, while Jenny rediscovers her human feelings for passion.

How can you pass this up?!? It was penned by the UNEQUALLED KEVIN SMITH HIMSELF, and fits perfectly into the NEW JERSEY MYTHOLOGY that began with CLERKS, and has spun all the way to DOGMA!

Plus, it has AN INTRODUCTION FROM GOD HERSELF, ALANIS MORISSETTE!!! (At least, she plays God in the movie...) Oh! Did I mention this monster is SIGNED BY KEVIN SMITH (who not only plays Silent Bob, but is secretly a Ninja Master), JASON MEWES (who plays Jay, and is kind to kitties and puppies), and DUNCAN FEGRADO (the artist, who has threatened my life if I mention the \"Stripper Incident\").

Four Bonds. One set. This sprawling collection surveys over 30 years of James Bond skullduggery, from the cold war tensions of the 1960s to the international free-for-all of the present. Sean Connery remains the coolest of the Bonds, a ruthless agent with dry martini wit and a way with the women, and in Goldfinger his steely presence helped forge the Bond formula of tongue-in-cheek wit, wondrous secret agent toys created by Q, and megalomaniac supervillains bent on world destruction. Thunderball upped the Bond ante with the most ambitious adventure--and budget--to date. Roger Moore brought an altogether lighter tone to 007 with Live and Let Die, softening Connery's rough edges with a more romantic persona as the films became even more exotic. After a brief digression into outer space, For Your Eyes Only returned Bond to globetrotting high adventure and teamed him with his most endearing ally (Topol as a gregarious smuggler). Timothy Dalton made his second and final appearance as Bond in Licence to Kill, the toughest of the Bond films since Connery's early efforts. Though not a fan favorite, it's a sleek, solid adventure with an edge missing from the Moore pictures. Pierce Brosnan is the latest to take on 007's licence to kill, combining the best of Connery's cool and Moore's humor. GoldenEye is the best Bond film in years, a grand globetrotting adventure with lovely Bond girls and a tough new M (Judy Dench). Tomorrow Never Dies doesn't recapture that magic mix of action, gadgetry, and romance, but does feature the first Bond girl to match 007 blow for blow: Hong Kong action superstar Michelle Yeoh. Taken together, this set is a veritable cross-section of the many faces of James Bond. All that's missing is George Lazenby. Do I hear a nomination for set 2? BOND DVD SET DETAILS: Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) Commentary by the directors of each film, with cast and crew The James Bond Giftset Volume 1 Includes the Following: _ Licence to Kill _ For Your Eyes Only _ Tomorrow Never Dies _ Goldfinger _ A Live and Let Die _ Thunderball _ GoldenEye There are many extras on these DVDS... too much to name, but here is what is included below...

BID EARLY! BID OFTEN! THE STORY: Despite bearing the earmarks of a cheap slasher outing, this quirky little thriller emerges as a surprisingly original murder mystery with some well-executed twists. May Britt (formerly Mrs. Sammy Davis, Jr.) plays a seemingly innocent farm girl (with more than a few toys rolling loose in the attic) convinced that her slovenly uncle (played by a delightfully grumpy Cameron Mitchell) is the man responsible for the grisly scissor-murders of several local girls. The validity of her suspicions has little bearing on the story's outcome, as the plot takes a rather unexpected turn halfway through. This seedy but fun horror film is buoyed by Britt's enjoyably loony performance, coupled with the cranky antics of Mitchell and Aldo Ray as the town's drunken sheriff. ================================================== RARE ================================================== A woman's perception of time becomes hopelessly distorted when a series of grisly murders occur in the small country town in which she lives.

The celebration of the music of ARTHUR FREED's Hollywood Musicals starred SHIRLEY JONES, HOWARD KEEL, RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN, NANETTE FABRAY, YVETTE MIMIUX and JULIET PROWSE and was hosted by DONALD O'CONNOR. Noted for writing the score for 1929's \"Broadway Melody\", ARTHUR FREED had a fruitful career in the motion picture industry first as a lyricist (a few of his songs are \"Singin' in the Rain\", \"Pagan Love Song\", \"All I Do is Dream of You\", \"I Cried For You\", \"Alone\" and \"You are My Lucky Star\") and later as the most successful producer in the history of the Movie Musical. Among his many productions were \"BABES IN ARMS\", \"ZIEGFELD FOLLIES\", \"THE WIZARD OF OZ\", \"FOR ME AND MY GAL\", \"GIRL CRAZY\", \"MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS\", \"THE HARVEY GIRLS\", \"TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY\", \"GOOD NEWS\", \"EASTER PARADE\", \"WORDS AND MUSIC\", \"ON THE TOWN\", \"ROYAL WEDDING\", \"ANNIE GET YOUR GUN\", \"SHOW BOAT\", \"AN AMERICAN IN PARIS\", \"BRIGADOON\", \"KISMET\", \"IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER\", \"THE BAND WAGON\", \"SILK STOCKINGS\", \"GIGI\" and \"BELLS ARE RINGING\" ... The 1962 NBC program begins with host DONALD O'CONNOR sharing some insight into the importance of Arthur Freed in the emergence of the Hollywood musical. HOWARD KEEL follows a bevy of bombshells in singing the title song from 1929's \"Broadway Melody\" and NANETTE FABRAY sings \"If I Had a Talking Picture of You\" from 1929's \"Sunny Side Up\". Next, HOWARD KEEL sings the lovely JEROME KERN and OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN 2nd melody \"Lovely To Look At\" from the 1952 film of the same name followed by a radiant SHIRLEY JONES singing the Gershwin's \"Love Walked In\" from the 1938 movie musical \"Goldwyn Follies\". DONALD O'CONNOR performs a lively tap to \"Forty-Second Street\" before he introduces \"TV's Dr. Kildare\", RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN (announcing it as his first musical TV appearance). Richard Chamberlain introduces several sketches including a comic scene of Opening Night at the \"Frolics 1931\" with DONALD O'CONNOR, NANETTE FABRAY, HOWARD KEEL and JULIET PROWSE followed by a scene from the college musical \"Varsity Stomp\" with HOWARD KEEL and SHIRLEY JONES. Next, SHIRLEY JONES and RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN sing the beautiful duet \"I Love New York in June\" followed by a series of dance numbers by JULIET PROWSE including the classic HAROLD ARLEN melody \"Get Happy\" made famous by JUDY GARLAND. A campy salute to the movie musicals of JEANETTE MACDONALD and NELSON EDDY follows as NANETTE FABRAY is backed by what appears to be a cast of thousands. SHIRLEY JONES, DONALD O'CONNOR, NANETTE FABRAY, HOWARD KEEL and JULIET PROWSE perform a medley of tunes from ARTHUR FREED musicals (finishing with a rousing rendition of \"Singin' in the Rain\") followed by YVETTE MIMIUX hosting a screening of scenes from various Freed films including \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (JUDY GARLAND), \"On the Town\" (GENE KELLY & FRANK SINATRA), \"Ziegfeld Follies\" (FRED ASTAIRE & GENE KELLY), \"An American in Paris\" (GENE KELLY & LESLIE CARON) and \"Gigi\" (LOUIS JOURDON). Next, ARTHUR FREED is introduced and briefly discusses his career with MGM before introducing songs from his upcoming film projects (several of which came to fruition without Freed). First, RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN sings a couple lines of \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" from Billy Rose's \"JUMBO\" followed by NANETTE FABRAY and \"A Grand Night for Singing\" from RICHARD RODGERS and OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN 2nd's \"STATE FAIR\". This is followed by a couple lines of \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" from \"CARNIVAL\" sung beautifully by SHIRLEY JONES, \"Tonight\" from \"WEST SIDE STORY\" by HOWARD KEEL, \"Put On a Happy Face\" from \"BYE BYE BIRDIE\" sung by JULIET PROWSE and finally \"Seventy-Six Trombones\" from MEREDITH WILLSON's \"THE MUSIC MAN\" performed by DONALD O'CONNOR ...

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watching wuxia films as a youngster and made Crouching Tiger as a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau ( The Killer, The Bride with White Hair ) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work on The Matrix . Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.

Dusty herself performs \"Get Ready,\" \"All I See Is You,\" \"Nowhere To Run,\" an Irish folk song, and \"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love.\" As one of the few extant segments of Dusty's TV series, this episode was heavily excerpted in the French and Saunders \"Full Circle\" special in 1994................. Next is an episode of Lulu's series, with guest stars the Everly Brothers; they perform \"Bye Bye Love,\" and duet with Lulu on \"Walk Right Back.\" Lulu serves up the Judy Garland chestnut \"The Trolley Song\" (made famous again in the 80s on Saturday Night Live by the Sweeney Sisters). Also featured is the dour British comic Les Dawson; he, too, sings a duet with Lulu!............. Then, a segment of Cilla Black's show, with guest stars Sandie Shaw and Cliff Richard, each performing a Eurovision winner; Sandie seems uneasy as she runs through \"Puppet on a String,\" while Cliff enthusiastically glides through \"Congratulations.\" Sandie also sings the Bee Gees number \"Words,\" and Cliff does a duet with Cilla. And, of course, Ms. Black opens the show with her John Lennon-Paul McCartney-penned theme song \"Step Inside Love\" ............... Finally, an episode of THE SANDIE SHAW SUPPLEMENT, with guest star John Walker of the Walker Brothers (who performs \"By The Time I Get to Phoenix\"). Sandie sings \"Route 66,\" \"Do You Know The Way to San Jose,\" and \"Girl Don't Come,\" and a duet with John Walker on \"Homeward Bound.\" ............ AND, as if THAT weren't enough, the tape is filled out with bonus 60s TV appearances by all four of the aforementioned divas. Total running time is just about two hours. Buyer pays shipping.

Original posters are the most desirable to collectors, but unfortunately, the older and more popular the film, the costlier the posters can be. Horror and sci-fi films from the 30s to the 50s are generally some of the most collectible due to their popularity and rarity. Any original, and even re-release posters from these periods that show the main actor(s)-Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney, Lorre, Price, etc. or the main monster from the film, are generally the more expensive items and hardest to find. My auctions will most often be for lobby cards, but I also have various other posters and memorabilia. You can find reproduction lobby cards and posters in many auctions, and for the budget minded person who only wants to see paper from their favorite films, these should suffice. But serious collectors only settle for the real thing. I ONLY offer AUTHENTIC, ORIGINAL OR RE-RELEASE POSTERS-NO REPRODUCTIONS, so bid with CONFIDENCE. EMPIRE OF THE ANTS Starring ROBERT LANSING! 11X14 Any GLARE on image shown is NOT due to a flaw on the poster, but is the result of the reflected camera flash. EXCELENT CONDITION-!(see bottom for description definitions). I apologize, but I am unable to send notifications when payments are received and items are mailed, due to the number of auctions I run. I am a ONE-PERSON operation, so time is at a premium. I try to do mailings on Mondays, so your item will be mailed the Monday following receipt of payment(unless paid by personal check). BE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR ADDRESS AND THE ITEM NAME AND NUMBER YOU ARE PAYING FOR WHEN YOU SEND PAYMENT, OR USE PAYPAL. MISSING INFO WILL CAUSE A DELAY IN SHIPPING. Thanx for understanding. Please e-mail with any questions BEFORE end of auction. I am not available on weekends, so I can respond only during the week. Since all items are at risk to sell below value, all sales are FINAL. ALL FUNDS IN US DOLLARS ONLY. Payment must be received within 10 days from close of auction. . BIDDERS OUTSIDE OF US MAY PAY BY PAYPAL WHERE AVAILABLE, OR BY CHECK OR MO FOR US FUNDS.

Cast out of Paradise by a wrathful God, the pair looks to beautiful Lucifer to fulfill his promise and grant them the secret knowledge of the trees. So begins The Annunciation, Andras Jeles' stunning, epic account of the dark history of humanity as portrayed entirely by children between 8 and 12 years of age. Photographed against the breathtaking fields, forests, mesas and shores of southern Hungary, The Annunciation sends 12 year -old Adam on an existential odyssey through time and space. He becomes a general in Athens, a crusader in Byzantium, Danton during the French Revolution, and a witness to the plague in London. As guided by a deceptively sweet, ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of Rapists and concubines, betrayal and savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism. Superbly photographed, colorfully costumed and stunningly acted, The Annunciation makes Pasolini-like uses of its youthful cast to illustrate the horror and irrationality of our times.

In this entertaining appraisal, the author examines not only the mainsprings of his unique multi-faceted talent, but aspects of his personality that made for a turbulent and much-publicized private life. It is the performer that is remembered, for Sellers was more than just \"The Man of a Thousand Masks\", he was an actor that puched the art of comedy in a new direction.

There are 28 embroidered blocks with the letter of the alphabet and an embroidered picture of an animal or item that represents that letter. Two of the blocks do not have a letter, but are on the quilt to balance it, I guess.The pictures include:apple, bird,cat,dog,elephant, frog, goose, Humpty Dumpty,ice cream, jack-in-the -box, king, lamb,mouse, nest, owl, pig,queen,rabbit, squirrel, turtle,umbrella,violets,wagon,xylophone,yarn, zebra.These are all done in vibrant cross stitch! I believe the front is machine quilted, the embroidery is hand done, and the ruffled edge is attached to the quilt by machine stitching very close to the edge of the quilt. The ruffled edge is 2 1/2 inches wide, and is double thickness with the raw edges together under the front and back of the quilt, not visible.The material is cotton all around, and the edge and backing are done in blue and white checks.The quilting does not go through to the backing, which is attached to the quilt at the edges next to the ruffle. In mint condition with no soiling, stains, odors,tears, holes, or fraying.This one is the best! A fabulous wall hanging or as a quilt for a lucky, beloved child!
