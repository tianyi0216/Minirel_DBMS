So this is an opportunity Indians have a long history of producing hand made rugs and special talent in reproduction of rugs. After the recent revolution in Iran, many manufacturers and exporters of Persian rugs left the country and immigrated to European and American countries. The migration resulted in the knowledge of European taste and demand as they started a whole new era of producing handmade rugs in new design and fashion. They started reproducing antique Persian rugs in exactly the same fashion and techniques that were hundreds of years old, and surely were able change the trend by offering new production. Due to situations in Iran, most of the production took place in India. Production of Persian designs in particular reproductions of antique Persian rugs captured the American and European markets. One of the main rugs they promoted was the antique Persian Heriz, which have been one of the top names in antique rugs. Antique Heriz rugs are sold in upscale galleries for outrageous prices. Heriz rugs are famous for having soft colors and clear designs. These rugs have been targeted among designers and decorators all over the world. Most have a large central medallion embedded within a lighter field, and the main color scheme of the rug is usually some shade of brick Red. In addition to being decorative and beautiful, Heriz rugs are extremely durable and capable of handling heavy traffic, made to last life time. Unfortunately, not many antique Heriz rugs are around and when they are, you find them with a lot of wear and outrageous prices. These rugs are made of the finest handspun wool on cotton foundation. Heriz rugs bring lots of attraction and decoration to any room, as they can easily compliment your traditional furniture, as well as with modern and contemporary settings. Since they have been fashionable rugs for hundreds of years, they will never go out of fashion and will always maintain their classic spirit, accumulating age and history as they are passed down from generation to generation. _____ Satisfaction Guaranteed _ _ Bid with confidence, if you are not satisfied with your item you may return it within a week for refund less shipping charges.

The Scarecrow has a handsome face and a charm all his own, in this limited edition Christmas ornament, made in Poland by the famous Christopher Radko. He's part of a series of Wizard of Oz ornaments sold exclusively by the Warner Brothers Studio Store in the 1998 season. There was a scheduled run of 10,000 of these -- this one is numbered 1052. And since the Warner Brothers stores have been closing one-by-one coast-to-coast, this may be an item that was more rare than anticipated. This ornament has been lovingly stored in a climate controlled environment. No excessive heat, cold or humidity. This ornament has been displayed over the holidays at least once before. But this piece has always been put away better than it came from the store -- in acid-free archival tissue paper -- inside a ziploc bag to protect it from outside moisture -- and with extra padding. You'll find Radko's original tag enclosed as well. The box is in good condition. We've treated our Radko ornaments as treasured investments. We hope you will too. The Scarecrow originally sold for $45, when he was introduced in 1998. Please note that the opening bid is far below that, and the value of this lovely ornament should increase as years go by. So, if you would like something special from the Yellow Brick Road to bring a little bit of Oz to your Christmas tree, enter your opening bid now. Thanks for looking! Good luck! And Happy Holidays!

NO transactions by mail. No sale or shipment outside U.S.A.) POP BOTTLE MAGIC COMBO TWO AMAZING TRICKS (1) STARTLING POP BOTTLE PRODUCTION THERE IS NO FASTER BOTTLE PRODUCTION IN MAGIC! Imagine this effect: Away from all furniture or people, with your empty hands you pick up an empty sheet of newspaper, which you show all around, all sides of it. Then with no false moves, with your hands and the newspaper well away from your body, you crumple up the newspaper into a ball. Instantly, out of the balled-up newspaper pops a real bottle of pop or beer, which you can drink, give to spectator, or pour into a glass. The production is just that quick and just that clean! No suspicious moves. No steals from tables, chairs, or other persons. No sleeve load. No spills. No skill. The production is equally amazing on stage or in front of small audiences. I have used it in TV commercials and in shows of all kinds. Not an impromptu trick. You receive clear, complete, illustrated instructions and an astonishingly effective but very simple device. PLUS (2) SIR ISAAC NEWTON WOULD FLIP HIS LID IF HE SAW THE POP or BEER BOTTLE ANTIGRAVITY TRICK! THE PICTURE SHOWS THE TRICK IN ACTUAL OPERATION. YOU SEE SEVERAL TOOTHPICKS AND A PENCIL THAT HAVE BEEN INSERTED INTO THE MOUTH OF THE INVERTED BOTTLE OF WATER. THE TRICK NOW COMES WITH TWO OF THE GIMMICKS SO YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SPARE! This is a famous and excellent impromptu pocket trick, endorsed by renowned magician and author, Dr. Harlan Tarbell, and many other famous magicians. Dr. Tarbell is said to have carried one of these \"invisible\" gimmicks for amazing \"impromptu\" performances. Dr. Tarbell wrote about how he used the effect in his shows, and wrote about its inventor, John Isely. John Scarne published a makeshift version of the trick in his magic book, although he did not reveal the real secret. This amazing trick depends on a very simple but ingenious little unseen gimmick that is always ready and extremely easy to use. You can carry this \"little wonder\" with you at all times. You will then be ready to baffle onlookers any place that you can simply borrow a pop bottle or beer bottle of water. Spectators watch closely as you take an unprepared bottle of water and turn it totally upside down, yet the water obeys your magical command and DEFIES GRAVITY--THE WATER DOES NOT RUN OUT OF THE BOTTLE! To prove it's real, you insert matches, toothpicks, and pencils into mouth of inverted bottle--they float up to the top of the water--yet THE WATER STILL DOES NOT RUN OUT OF THE BOTTLE. The water remains suspended in the inverted bottle until you will it to pour out! Spectators may examine the bottle with a microscope! REMEMBER, SPECTATOR MAY FILL THE BOTTLE, EXAMINE IT BEFORE AND AFTER YOUR TRICK, AND EMPTY IT. Some of my customers produce a pop bottle of water using our Startling Pop Bottle Production, hand the bottle out for examination, then take the bottle back and immediately perform this antigravity trick. Perform this anywhere, anytime. No skill required. \"Impromptu\" tricks as outstanding and effective as this one are few, but even one such trick performed properly can greatly enhance a magician's reputation. You receive original, copyright, clear, step-by-step instructions and presentation tips that make the performing very easy. REMEMBER, I NOW PROVIDE YOU WITH TWO OF THE \"ANTIGRAVITY\" GIMMICKS SO YOU WILL HAVE A SPARE IF YOU SHOULD LOSE ONE. THE POP BOTTLE MAGIC COMBO - BOTH THE ABOVE TRICKS - $10.97 PLUS $1.26 SHIPPING.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

Enter the Hulk. The good Doctor Banner we all know and love. He's in the future fighting against himself for the sake of humanity. In the past the Hulk has battled his share of power-mad tyrants before: Draxon the Dictator, the Gremlin, Farnoq Dahn of Trans-Sabal, and the Leader. But now he must face himself--the most hateful and powerful dictator of the worst of all possible realities. The Hulk is trapped in a world he made. Peter David has said that he is most proud of this work. This 2 issue mini-series is a fine example comics collaboration, and characteristic of David's ability to bring out the best in artists.

This is the 10 inch skillet, with two pouring spouts. It would be a good frying pan to use, or it would look good hanging in your kitchen! Identification The pan is marked on the base \"Wagner's 1891 Original Cast Iron Cookware 10 Inch Skillet Made in USA.\" The pan also has seasoning instructions on the underside. Condition The pan is in good used condition! It has some cooking residue and light surface rust, but it will probably clean up just fine. I have not attempted to clean this pan. There is a small notch in the pan's rim, but I think the pan was molded that way; I don't think it is a chip in the iron. Customer Service Pledge Please note: I NEVER charge a handling fee on my eBay transactions! It seems more and more that sellers like me are in the minority. I use only quality packing materials like peanuts and bubble wrap (where applicable), the cost of which I absorb as a conscientious seller. Don't be afraid to bid on my items because you think there might be hidden costs, undisclosed information, slow response, or shoddy packing!

If you plan on purchasing more than one item and wish to consolidate shipping do not use the \"checkout\" option which appears after an auction closes. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won.
