VHS VIDEO TAPE ~ A modern movie masterpiece, Disney's Beauty and the Beast waltzed away with six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture -- the first ever for an animated film. Along with winning the prestigious Best Picture Golden Globe Award, it now ranks among history's most highly acclaimed cinematic achievements. When the film's beautiful book-loving heroine, Belle, sings the first of an unprecedented three Oscar-nominated songs, you too will fall instantly under its spell. However, it is the spell of an enchantress that opens this classic fairy talk, turning a cruel prince into a hideous beast. His stubborn pride compels him to remain in his bewitched castle -- inhabited by Lumiere the lovestruck candelabra, Cogsworth the pompous clock, the kindly Mrs. Potts, and an inquisitive little teacup named Chip. To break the spell, the Beast must win Belle's love before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. With a colorful cast of endearing Disney characters, Beauty and the beast will enthrall both young and old, forever reminding us that true beauty comes from within.

These are not dubbed or copied, but are the genuine products available here in the U.S. Please beware of others' \"copied\" products. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs & More VHS Set o Starring: Elmo o NTSC format (US and Canada only) o Color, Closed-captioned, NTSC Sesame Street's cheerful redhead chuckles his way through this delightful 50-minute compilation of three favorite \"Elmo's World\" episodes. First come the babies: real babies, Muppet babies, and animal babies. With help from Mister Noodle, a cast of Muppets, and video vignettes featuring humans, Elmo discovers what babies can do and how to play with them. Next come the dogs. Once again, Elmo's on the move--this time to share important tips about respecting the family pet. The final episode examines life on the farm. Viewers will observe youngsters accomplishing daily farm chores as well as Muppet farmers and barn animals punning around. As Elmo bops around his house (simply drawn and \"furnished\" with color crayon sketches), he chats with Dorothy the pet goldfish, poses questions to Mister Noodle, and tunes in to his friendly television for helpful cartoons presented by \"The Baby Channel,\" \"The Dog Channel,\" and of course, \"The Farm Channel.\" Educational and entertaining for the younger crowd, each segment explores its topic using a variety of creative, quick-paced methods, enhanced by an upbeat soundtrack. From the moment we put this video in the VCR, my then-baby, now-toddler, loved this video. She runs up to the television to hug Elmo, and plays peek-a-boo with him in front of the set. When my husband or I are alone with her, we can pop the video in the VCR, put her in her crib, and take a quiet shower while she watches Elmo for 15 minutes. This is by far the best video we have for her, and highly recommend it to any parent who needs 5 or 10 minutes of \"breathe time\" to occupy an otherwise inconsolable toddler.

Both were totally fictional rock/pop \"bands\" produced by Screen Gems, the television branch of Columbia Pictures. While the Monkees (TV series and band concept) were styled as mid-'60s counter-culture zaniness _ la the Beatles' film Hard Days Night, the Partridge Family was strictly wholesome with traditional family values despite the lite quasi-hip tone of the show. The top-rated series first-aired on ABC from 1970 to 1974, premiering September 25, 1970. Besides the face and voice of David Cassidy ,one of the other draws of the show was the uncanny deadpan timing of Danny Bonaduce as Danny Partridge and the simmering neurosis of the group's manager Reuben Kincaid as played by Dave Madden. When sharing a scene together, the two were hysterical. Starring stage and screen veteran Shirley Jones and then up-and-coming actor David Cassidy, The Partridge Family was loosely based on real-life family pop/rock band the Cowsills (\"Hair,\" \"The Rain, The Park & Other Things,\" \"Indian Lake,\" \"Love American Style\"). The other Partridge siblings were Susan Dey as Laurie, Suzanne Crough as Tracy, and Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris during the first season. Gelbwaks' parents felt uncomfortable with the ensuing mania that surrounded the show and took the youngster out of the cast. He was replaced in the role by Brian Foster. Don't miss out on your chance to bid on this muscial cult favorite pictured here in their Mondrian-esque bus. This extremely rare reproduction is signed by Shirley Jones, Susan Dey & David Cassidy & is offered (here) at an unbelievable low minimum bid. Winning bid to add $5.00 for postage & handling.

One day he beats a local bully who was harassing a poor man in the market. The bully's father complains to Freddy's father, insisting on repayment of the damages done. Freddy has already been a handful for his father, Master Wong, so this latest incident is the last straw. In order to teach Freddy a lesson, Master Wong seeks out Sam Seed, a hard-driving kung-fu master who has a reputation for breaking his students. Freddy's friends warn him about the teacher's reputation so he heads for the hills. Unfortunately the eccentric old man he meets in a restaurant just happens to be Sam Seed himself. Seeds drills Freddy mercilessly for months, and Freddy makes many attempts to escape. Eventually Sam Seed shares the secret of his unusual fighting style-liquor! Filled with the spectacular stunts and broad slapstick that have become Jackie Chan's trademark, DRUNKEN MASTER is a hilarious and appealing martial arts film.

In those years, caricaturists found an avid audience in the readers of magazines including VANITY FAIR and THE NEW YORKER. It was the beginning of the modern cult of celebrity. Auerbach-Levy was in the center of the action in New York and drew caricatures of some of the most famous celebrities of the day. This is a high quality lithographic poster published in 1977 promoting the Auerbach-Levy collection of drawings at the Museum of the City of New York. Auerbach-Levy's original drawing from 1924 was deftly executed with brush and ink. The freshness of his brushstrokes and line are beautifully captured by the lithography of the original. Overall size is 28\" by 22\". Condition: 33 year old poster, paper has slightly greyed. This piece is printed on high-quality paper. It far exceeds the quality of a normal poster.

We can't decide the other characters. The top of the lamp is an old style film maker (camera) with the handle. This is approx. 30 inches tall without a shade on it(doesn't come with a shade or bulb). There are some paint chips, which I am sure could be touched up. There is a chip in the camera itself, maybe a small fill in and a touch of paint. The pink hat on the woman has also got a small chip, I would say same as camera(could be fixed nicely). There are no actual Cracks anywhere that I have found.

Description: In Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a woman does what she's expected to--especially if she's expecting. Angie (Geena Davis) is just a little too independent for that, and when her long-time boyfriend gets her pregnant she decides to do things entirely her own way, shocking everyone in this often comedic look at one woman's search for self. This heartwarming story is based on the novel ANGIE, I SAYS by Avra Wing. Apparently Madonna was up for the role of Angie and was dismissed in favor of Geena Davis. The rumor is that Madonna therefore wrote an angry, sarcastic letter on this topic to Disney, and producer Joe Roth, claiming she had initiated the project with writer Todd Graff. Disney maintained that Madonna, attached from the beginning, had opted to do the film SNAKE EYES (aka DANGEROUS GAME) instead.James Gandolfini (Vinnie) and Aida Turturro (Tina) played brother and sister on the HBO series THE SOPRANOS. Rated R and 108 Minutes. PayPal, Billpoint, Bidpay, CCNow, cash (USA Currency), check (drawn on USA financial institution) or money orders are accepted.

Super Rare- This is an absolutely incredible piece of motion picture history! This contact sheet contains 19 frame by frame pictures from the TITLE SCENE! Frames 6718-6736 clearly depict Lucille Ball and Robert Preston singing and dancing to the title song, Mame. The sheet is 11\" x 14\", and each frame is 2.5\" x 1.75\" This contact sheet is dated 4-6-73, and was used by those promoting the movie to determine which shots would be used for publicity pictures. Some of the frames have orange crayon markings on them, to distinguish frames which would not be used in the final prints. Frame 6735 contains a double hole punch beneath it, as well as two ruled pen markings (one on each side). The sheet itself is in nice condition, though the backside has some minor folding along one edge. The scan doesn't do it justice, because the whole sheet was too large for my scanner. There are an additional 7 and a half frames that did not fit in the scan. This is an unbelievable piece, and extremely rare! If you are a motion picture collector or Lucille Ball collector, you have just struck gold! This is a unique item that you can add to your collection, and be relatively sure there is nothing else quite like it! Buyer to pay shipping. International shipping will be higher.

York became a superior soldier. In fact, despite his moral objection to war, York became the most decorated man of WW I, earning his medals on the battlefields of Argonne when he single-handedly extinguished a German machine gun squadron armed with only a Springfeild rifle and a Colt .45 pistol. A pacifist turned patriot, York became not only a daring freedom fighter, but also one our nation's most revered heroes! Based on a true story and nominated for 11 Academy Awards, this \"powerful and engrossing\" (Look) WW I classic is an honest and fitting tribute to heroism that is further distinguished by the Oscar winning performance of the remarkable Gary Cooper. Gary Cooper Walter Brennan Joan Leslie George Tobias Stanley Ridges FACTS FROM THE VAULT Because WW II was approaching, York, after holding out for 23 years, agreed to let his life story be told on the condition that Gary Cooper play the lead. Mounted on a steel turntable so that 16 angles of it could be filmed, the 40-foot peak that york ascends to contemplate war was built from canvas and wood Select battle scenes were shot on an 80-acre barley farm that was strewn with charred tree trunks and made to look war-torn by five tons of dynamite.

The paint is applied with heavy coats and the effect is quite striking. Cuba is still producing some of these posters and the process is totally hand made. I divided these posters in two categories: original and reprinted . Original posters were printed the year the artist designed them, in small quantities (25-250) and most will not be reprinted again due to many factors (copyright legalities on the movie, lost of original screen etc).These are the most valuable for the collectors. Small tears around the white borders and yellowish color of the paper are considered normal for these original posters. Notice that these posters, unlike U.S movie posters are NOT folded and I send them rolled and ready to frame, eliminating the need of mounting on linen to be displayed. Reprints are newer posters produced by ICAIC (Cuban Institute of Art and Cinema) after 1995 when the cuban government began to sell to tourists. They are equally beautiful and impresive, hand made and limited in their editions. In 1991, the Center for Cuban Studies in New York spearheaded a successful lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury Department, which made the importation and sale of original art from Cuba legal. I do not sale cuban posters for a living. My husband and I have a very large collection that we adquired in Cuba and some other countries. We also trade with other collectors around the world. We only sell those we have duplicates and we use that money to adquire more posters for our collection. Title: Jinete Fantasma (Ghost Horserider) Year: 1971. (original) Artist: Munoz Bachs Medium: Silkscreen . Cuban posters feature vibrant colors and an unusual look, making them almost appear to be hand-painted works of art rather than printed posters. The paint is applied with heavy coats. The effect is quite striking. Condition: Very Good (note that small tears around white borders, yellowish color of the paper (when original first run) and small imperfections in the inks are often normal in cuban posters since they are handmade.If some other imperfections are present I will write it as part of the description.Truly collectable and beautifully preserved.

The six man crew was able to turn the plane toward Holland before they were forced to bail out. They came down in the Netherlands within miles of the Zuider Zee. With the determined assistance of the Dutch resistance the entire crew is passed from hand to hand through the German lines until they reached the North Sea. Soon they were back in England. The Dutch have a saying.... the sea is a common enemy and against a common enemy one must unite. Five of the Dutch resistance were executed for the assistance that they gave to the British Air Crew.

Six movies including: Star Trek--The Motion Picture: The crew of the Enterprise is reunited to combat a lethal force field headed toward Earth. Slow, talky, and derivative, somewhat redeemed by terrific special effects and majestic Jerry Goldsmith score; still, mainly for purists. Network and videocassette version--generally considered an improvement--runs 143m. Followed by many sequels--and several new TV series! Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: Kirk and the Enterprise crew must do battle with the nefarious villain of 1967's ``Space Seed'' episode. A bit hokey and pretentious at times, but a likable adventure overall, with nice touches of warmth and humor. Footage added for network showings. Originally released without the ``II'' in its title. Star Trek III: The Search for Spock: Picking up where #2 left off, Kirk reassembles his crew and shanghais the Enterprise to try and rescue Spock--in whatever form he may still be alive--while both he and the rapidly destructing Genesis Planet are endangered by a Klingon warship (led by Lloyd, in an ineffectual performance). Subdued sci-fi outing very much in keeping with tone of the original TV series... and therefore, recommended most heartily to Star Trek fans. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: The Enterprise crew takes a sharp left turn toward comedy in this uncharacteristic--and very entertaining--movie. Story has the familiar characters time-traveling back to the 20th century in order to save the Earth of the future, with the help of some humpback whales. Sheer novelty of the comic tone excuses some forays into the obvious; it's all in fun. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier: The Enterprise crew takes off on an emergency mission when an apparent madman takes over a distant planet and holds its interstellar ambassadors hostage; his motives, however, turn out to be anything but terroristic. Dramatically shaky trek starts off with a case of the cutes, and gets worse before it (finally) gets better. A weak entry in the series. Shatner's feature-film directing debut; he also shares story credit. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country: The Enterprise crew is assigned to negotiate truce with Klingon leader, only to fall prey to a trap set by one of his renegade cohorts (Plummer, in a deliciously flamboyant performance). Entertaining saga cowritten by director Meyer. Nimoy helped concoct the story and also executive produced. Video version has 2 minutes of additional footage.

Of course, the set-up will be strictly platonic. A disarming modern-day fairy tale, Pretty Woman was the picture that made Julia Roberts a superstar. As charming as she is in her \"giggling\" sequences, Roberts' best scene is her triumphant return to a posh Rodeo Drive shop where she'd been previously snubbed.

Butler - Set Designer Stephenie McMillan - Set Designer Ellen Mirojnick - Costume Designer John Mollo - Costume Designer Kevin Jewison - Camera Operator Keith Campbell - Stunts George Marshall Ruge - Stunts Neil Summers - Stunts Jim Wilkey - Stunts Brian Williams - Stunts Description: Partly based on Charlie Chaplin's My Autobiography, this humorous and dramatic biopic features an all-star cast including Oscar nominee Robert Downey, Jr., Dan Aykroyd, Anthony Hopkins, Kevin Kline, Diane Lane, and Chaplin's real life daughter, Geraldine Chaplin, who portrays his mentally ill mother. With the use of flashback, an elderly Chaplin discusses his autobiography with his editor (Hopkins), who urges him to be more vulnerable and emotionally honest with his memoirs while journeying through his poverty-stricken childhood, closest friendships, many marriages, merciless pursuit by J. Edgar Hoover (Kevin Dunn), and Chaplin's ingenious invention of \"The Little Tramp.\" Highlighted works such as The Gold Rush (1925) and The Great Dictator (1940) illustrate significant turning points in Chaplin's prolific filmography. Director Richard Attenborough's film also explores the circumstances surrounding Chaplin's exile from America and his eventual return to receive an honorary Academy Award. ? (Synopsis by: Lisa Kropiewnicki) The Academy Award-winning director of another biopic, Gandhi (1982), Richard Attenborough reveals his obvious reverence for the iconoclastic Charlie Chaplin in this critically if not commercially successful film. Robert Downey, Jr., who trained for over a year to replicate Chaplin's English cockney accent, tics and rhythm as well as his graceful balletic and athletic movements, physical humor, and posture, gives the star-making performance of his career and is riveting to watch as he brings to life one of the most influential people in the history of cinema. The film is a thoughtful mixture of melancholy and humor, juxtaposing Chaplin's private loneliness and loss with his professional comedic talents and fortitude. Spanning a period of nearly 80 years in the actor's life, the film has been criticized for trying to cover too much narrative ground, but given the enormity of Chaplin's contribution to his art and the personal obstacles he overcame, this is an enjoyable, emotional, and authentic film. From its rural Hollywood locations in the early 1900's and demonstration of early movie-making techniques to its superb cast, Chaplin (1992} is a potent tribute to a gifted cinematic artist. ?

This superbly acted, mordantly funny romp through 70 years or so of Roman history is one of the best-loved miniseries ever made, and deservedly so. Derek Jacobi plays Roman Emperor Claudius, who reflects in old age on his life and his remarkable family, giving us a history lesson that's unlike anything you learned in school. The story begins in 24 B.C. during the reign of Augustus Caesar, Rome's first emperor, and ends in A.D. 54 with Nero on the throne. In between, I, Claudius details the scheming, murder, madness, and lust that passed for politics in the early years of the Pax Romana. Further acting honors go to George Baker as Tiberius and to John Hurt as a hilarious and absolutely terrifying Caligula. The topnotch cast and the incident-filled plot are more than enough to hold the attention through almost 11 hours of gripping, deliciously wicked Roman follies. This particular box set is in mint condition, as it has hardly been used. The tapes are all in perfect working order, and the box looks new. All in all, this collection is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of historical drama and intrigue.

What you are Bidding On: #153 JIM THORPE ALL AMERICAN LC #2 '51 Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Lobby Card #2 (Measures 11\" x 14\") Description: Jim Thorpe - All American, the 1951 Michael Curtiz Olympic decathlon sports biography of Jim Thorpe (the greatest athlete of all time, even though he was stripped of his Olympic medals) starring Burt Lancaster, Charles Bickford, Steve Cochran, and Phyllis Thaxter Note that this lobby card shows Lancaster as Thorpe in full football uniform surrounded by other players. Condition & Defects: very good. There is a tiny creased area in the right of the bottom border below the tiny writing at the bottom. There is a pinhole in the left corners and two in the top right corner. There is minor smudging in the blank borders and a stain in the right of the bottom blank border. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. Lobby Cards measure 11\" x 14\" and were almost always printed in sets of 8 (some lower budget films only had a set of 4). Many lobby card sets (usually pre-1970 sets) have a \"title card\". A title card normally has artwork and the credits from the film, and is different in appearance from the other seven cards in the set. The artwork is usually the same as that of the artwork on one of the styles of half-sheet.

The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction \"completed\" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first.

The artwork is usually the same as that of the artwork on one of the styles of half-sheet.

What you are Bidding On: #402 COMMANDO CODY 1sh '53 sci-fi serial! Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Chapter #4 Folded One-Sheet (27\" x 41\") Description: From Chapter #4 of Commando Cody, the 1953 Franklin Adreon, Fred C. Brannon, & Harry Keller science fiction space serial starring Judd Holdren, Aline Towne, William Shallert, Richard Crane, and Grant Withers Condition & Defects: very good. There is some staining in the left of the chapter title box. There are minor creases in the blank border and a tack hole in each corner of the image background. The top blank border was folded back at one time. A 1 1/2\" x 4\" piece was torn off the bottom left corner but it is held on with tape from the back. There is a piece off the top left corner. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. One-Sheets are the standard movie poster size, what you see outside of any movie theater. From 1896 until roughly 1990, almost all actual theater-used one-sheets measured 27\" x 41\" (since then, most one-sheets measure 27\" x 40\"). Up until 1980 (or thereabouts) the vast majority of one-sheets were folded twice horizontally and once vertically (this is in no way considered a defect). Sometime during the late '70s, studios began printing one-sheets rolled. Most one-sheets after the mid-1980s are printed unfolded, though it is still possible to find some newer posters folded. Most newer one-sheets are printed double-sided (with a mirror image on the back) for use in a light box in front of the theaters. However, sometimes the studios print some posters single-sided. All of the one-sheets (unless otherwise noted) being sold by eMoviePoster are original vintage theater-used one-sheets! Click here to view the hundreds of other items we have for sale on eBay!

What you are Bidding On: #409 KRONOS 1sh '57 Morrow, Lawrence Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Folded One-Sheet (27\" x 41\") Description: Kronos, the 1957 Kurt Neumann horror science fiction film (\"Most Horrifying Monster of All Time!\"; \"Planet Robber Tramples The Earth!\") starring Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence, John Emery, George O'Hanlon, Morris Ankrum, Kenneth Alton, and John Parrish Condition & Defects: fine. There are faint minor creases in the blank borders. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. One-Sheets are the standard movie poster size, what you see outside of any movie theater. From 1896 until roughly 1990, almost all actual theater-used one-sheets measured 27\" x 41\" (since then, most one-sheets measure 27\" x 40\"). Up until 1980 (or thereabouts) the vast majority of one-sheets were folded twice horizontally and once vertically (this is in no way considered a defect). Sometime during the late '70s, studios began printing one-sheets rolled. Most one-sheets after the mid-1980s are printed unfolded, though it is still possible to find some newer posters folded. Most newer one-sheets are printed double-sided (with a mirror image on the back) for use in a light box in front of the theaters. However, sometimes the studios print some posters single-sided. All of the one-sheets (unless otherwise noted) being sold by eMoviePoster are original vintage theater-used one-sheets! Click here to view the hundreds of other items we have for sale on eBay!
