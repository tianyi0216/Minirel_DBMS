Welcome To Our Auctions by Canadianas, Bookmark us and check back weekly, we always get new and some really neat things, FOR TIPS ON HOW TO KEEP AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR FURS AND LEATHERS SEE THIS IN ABOUT ME! ALL FURS ARE REAL unless otherwise stated. Ebay has now added a new feature to block deadbeat buyers from bidding on sellers items - you guessed it - you bid and don't pay, you are on this list from here on in :-(( Sorry!! PLEASE DO NOT ASK US TO STOP ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS! Our Stock #V70. Shipping via air mail to Canada and U.S. only on this item including handling and insurance would be $20.00. Model is 5'3\", 120 pounds, shoulders 16\", hips 38\" a with size range of 8-10. Measurements and Particulars Item Type and Colour - This is a ladies petite coyote longer fur coat. Shoulders across top - 16\" this is a very important measurement! Chest by tape measure - 34\" Waist - 30\" Hips -36\" Arms measured from top of shoulder to where the coat arm ends at cuff - 22\" Length - 43\" Sweep - 54\" Designer - No label Age of Item - Unknown Size on tag or estimated here only, but PLEASE go by our measurements 2-7 Front Detail - Hooks up front, pockets on sides. Condition Detail - Fur supple, minor finger wear pocket edge. Stress areas around the arm have been checked, no rips or tears. Our Rating - 8 Lining - Taupe condition good. Please Read Our Conditions and Instructions below the photos. All items are USED unless otherwise stated, and measured on outside with items done up. The rating does not reflect age but condition only, as is visible to us. Coats may or may not be vintage as we have no way of knowing their age. A rating of 10 is LIKE NEW or NEW and we usually only rate a 10 on new items. A 9 is in good condition with no mentionable signs of wear that we feel is obvious, but keeping in mind these are used coats. An 8 is showing signs of wear that we could find on FUR or LINING as described but still in good condition, or that we consider it vintage. A 7 is wear is obvious in mentioned areas but still very wearable. Anything 6 and under we list as crafts, you can determine from write-up whether you can fix it or use it to remake other items. All furs may or may not have a monogram . If this is a concern please ask before auction is over, we can REMOVE THEM for an extra $25.00, just let us know if you would like this option, however we do not do monogramming, you would have to have this done. All furs will have been repaired if required, or damage as described in writeup. It is up to YOU to know what type of fur you are bidding on, as each one has its own qualities and textures. I am a non smoker and to the best of my ability try to detect odours on the furs we purchase, we will not buy ones that I can detect a smell, other than the fur smell itself. If you find your coat has an odour, an airing for a couple of hours outside, generally works well to freshen it up, but if you have a super sensitive sniffer :-) best buy new! If you are buying a fur for a present and are uncertain about measurements, it is a good idea to get a coat that fits the person you are buying for, lie the coat flat on the ground, done up, and take a tape measure and measure, underarm to underarm for chest, shoulder seam to wrist for arms, etc. etc. Hope this helps! As you can see by our positives, we have a high level of customer satisfaction. . Item \"as is\", \"all sales are final-no refunds\". We are not responsible for lost or stolen items from the mail!

I've posted so many auctions up that eBay's search function stopped working on me, and splitting the auctions between the IDs made it work again. I made the auction pages look the same so you'll still know its me, and I will still combine shipping charges just as before, regardless of which IDs auctions you bid on. ( If the picture does not appear click here for an alternate posting ) I accept MasterCard/Visa and checks/money orders in US funds. Checks hold to clear, otherwise I ship within 24 hours. Buyer to pay $2.00 for first-class shipping/handling in the U.S., with insurance optional (but HIGHLY recommended) at $1 for each $50 of value. Seller is not responsible for lost items if insurance waived. Most small items can be shipped airmail overseas for $3.00. California buyers pay sales tax. Please ask any questions before you bid. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. Returns accepted within one week of receipt and are for bid price less shipping and fees unless the item received is not as described. Please DON'T use eBay's 'Checkout' on my auctions. In addition to being unreliable, it only works on single items and most of my customers bid on multiple auctions. Until eBay makes Checkout optional the button will be part of all auctions, whether the seller wants it there or not.

The clothing I sell will be 95% from smoke free homes, and washed and pressed for you and inspected for stains and rips so none will be sold as much as can be helped. I will also offer a money back deal for you if you are not satisfied with your purchase. Just return it and I will send your money back. I will ship on Saturday Mornings and will ship mostly U.S. Postal 2-3 day mail since most clothing weighs to much to send any other mail class. I am signing up on paypal so I will take paypal payments. So at the end of the auction just email me for payment info. I will be moving from Nov 30th until Dec 3rd so if you have a delay in email replay please be patient this will not effect my shipments._ Also book mark my sales if you want to come back to shop.

My hobby is creating new designs of clothing. I have been learning how to make clothes since 1975; even though I am a man and at that time most of the designers were women, that didn't stop me from learning and observing the fashion. That is why, then, I took the course of making clothes. \"My works are inspired by Balinese art and culture. Many tourists come to Bali to see and get to know more about Balinese art and culture. When they go back to their countries, of course they will bring something as presents to their families and friends. Then I create some clothes, which can be a present as well as a useful gift. \"In making clothes I use batik cotton textiles. I have researched these media to learn whether they contain toxins or not. The result is they are non-toxic. It is best to wash the clothes by hand (cool water) or machine wash (40__c) and avoid drying in direct sunshine. \"NOVICA is one way for young and small artists to promote their art works into the whole world.

Clinical Study Clinical Study : Longevity 4 (L-4) Conducted by Dr. Essman, Endocrinologist Date started on treatment: August 1, 1999 Date finished treatment: October 1, 1999 After 30 years of aging, levels of human growth hormone substantially decrease. Low levels of human growth hormone are directly associated with the many diseases associated with the aging process. Raised levels of HGH have produced health improvements and benefits. Dietary supplements composed of amino acids have been shown to promote the secretion of human growth hormone release. Pepsin has been shown to increase the amplitude and frequency of high release, in addition to amino acids. Argintine has been shown to diminish the effects of somatistatin, which is produced by the pituitary gland and inhibits human growth hormone from being distributed. Human growth hormone immediately changes into IGF-1 as we sleep. Increased IGF-1 levels indicate that human growth hormone have raised correspondingly."}, {"ItemID": "1676373215", "Name": "August Silk Men's Knitted Vest-M-Kelp Gr-NEW", "Category": ["Clothing & Accessories", "Men", "Clothing: Regular", "Vests"], "Currently": "$9.95", "First_Bid": "$9.95", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-10-01 17:16:30", "Ends": "Dec-15-01 17:16:30", "Seller": {"UserID": "maxishop", "Rating": "5434"}, "Description": "if (navigator.appName == 'Microsoft Internet Explorer') { if (navigator.appVersion.substring(0,1) \"); } else { document.write(\" \"); document.write(\" \"); document.write(\" \"); document.write(\" BODY { background: url(/espacio.GIF) }\"); document.write(\" \"); document.write(\" \"); } } else { //Default to Netscape settings. document.write(\" \"); } August Silk Men's Knitted Vest-M-Kelp Gr-NEW BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!

Money Back Guarantee if not 100% Satisfied! Slot Machine Secrets Section: Just What Are Loose Slot Machines? Not all slot machines are created equal. In the early days, slot machines were totally unpredictable. Each spin of the three reels was independent of other spins, making their stops completely random. There was no \"program\" to cause the reels to stop on winning combinations a pre-set number of times. Today's machines are programmed. Each casino must pay out a percentage of what ever they take in each and every day. On average, Slot Machines will pay out as winnings 80% to as high as 98% of all coins that were dropped into the machines. Loose machines are ones which pay back a higher percentage of what they take in. Not All Slot Machines Are Created Equal! In the same casino, you will have one slot machine that pays out 80% right next to a machine that pays out 98%, in fact casinos usually will do this for various reasons. Now which machine would you like to play!?! Loose slot machines are the ones that pay out a higher percentage of what they take in. These are the machines you want to play. Our Book \"Not All Slot Machines Are Created Equal\" will explain how casinos decide which machines to program as loose machines. These loose machines can actually pay out more coins in a days time then they take in. Loose machines must do this to make up for the very tight machine. Once you locate a loose machine just sit back and enjoy! This insider Slot Machines Secrets will help you in locating loose slot machines within any casino in less than 5 minutes! NOW INCLUDED! With each Slot Machine Secrets package we now include \"The Best Of The Slots\" . After doing extensive travel to both Atlantic City & Nevada we've compiled a chart which ranks 17 different casinos in terms of payouts! We have also evaluated the payout of $0.05, $0.25, $0.50, $1.00 and $5.00 machines. Now you will KNOW what machines to go to and which Casinos to PLAY IN! Blackjack Secrets Section: BlackJack Is One Of The Most Popular Games At The Casinos! Blackjack is a very popular game because its the only game in which the odds of winning are really under YOUR control. That's right, by following a few simple rules you can have the odds swing YOUR way! Our chapter on \"BlackJack Secrets\" will show you how! BlackJack is the only Casino game which YOU have a direct outcome of the game. Our package will show you when its best to bet greater amounts or lessor amounts of money. Our package starts you off with the basic rules of the game, written in a simple easy to understand language which a novice player will understand. Next you progress to a system of play in which the Casino no longer has any advantage over you! Finally you'll learn a system which DOES give YOU an advantage over the Casino. Many people have heard of Blackjack card counting, however not many people know how it works. The second part of our two part system follows some basic principles of card counting. However our system doesn't require any more math skills then the ability of adding 1 or subtracting 1! If you can add 1+1 you've got all the skills needed! You do not need the superior math and memorization skills needed for \"true\" card counting systems! However our method still give you a true advantage over the Casino!

Money Back Guarantee if not 100% Satisfied! Recent Comments I've Received from Our Customers! Dear George, I went to the casino Saturday and won and then I went back on Sunday and won again! The feeling of AT LAST leaving the casino as a winner is just a great feeling that I have been waiting for. I lived 8 years in Monte Carlo, Monaco and I was always loosing and now I know why thanks to your Slot Machine Secrets! Now I follow the advices step by step and it was such a pleasure to do this calmly, watching and then start to play. What Slot Machine Secrets advises you NOT to do was exactly what I observed with other players doing and they were LOOSING! When I started playing I WON immediately for the first time on the slot machines! Incredible Item! Kindest Regards, Robert Hervieu Just one day after Robert wrote me the above letter, he wrote me the following: Dear George, I DID IT AGAIN. I hit the JACKPOT on the Slot Machines. Will now take it easy for a while. Thank you again. Kindest Regards Robert Hervieu Dear George, I just wanted you to know that I took your advice in the book to heart about not sticking with one machine because it's due to pay off any moment when it hasn't been paying off very much or at all. Instead, I stayed with the machine you suggested and that machine paid off just before going to bed and 4 more times the next day. I kept going back to it and you were right about loose machines paying frequently! I even when to the machine after a woman hit an even bigger jackpot on it than I had and she walked away immediately. Within a few minutes, I hit another smaller but substantial jackpot to keep me going. I actually left Lake Tahoe with a few hundred dollars more than I arrived with. That has NEVER happened before! Thank you again for sharing your secrets! Very truly yours, Marlane Testimonials Copyright _ 2000 G. W. Fetter Hi, I'm George Fetter, the author of \"Slot Machine Secrets\". I've been playing Slot Machines for over 10 years. I've also been a computer programmer, software engineer and systems designer working on many \"Real-Time\" Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems which is what Casinos use to control Slot Machine payouts. These payouts are regulated by the Gaming Commission and every Casino must keep very tight control on their payout percentages or risk losing their Gaming License! To maintain this tight of a control, SCADA systems have been used in nearly every Casino in the world. \"Slot Machine Secrets\" will reveal how you can in only a few minutes, detect which Slot Machines to Play and which to walk away from.

This gown has a pale pink bodice with little embroidered baby rose buds over organza...Can be worn off the shoulder or on... More & more, brides are no longer choosing ALL white gowns for their special day! ALL white is a difficult color to wear for many, & nothing warms MOST skin tones more than flattering pale pink!

A draped, low ROMANTIC neckline frames the decollate which is ruched & embellished with MORE silk flowers white & pale pink baby rose buds & ostrich plumes! White pearls & silver bugle beads & INCREDIBLE lace trim dangle from front of bodice!

Sizing information: The most important measurement for the tuxedos is the chest which is measured all the way around just under the armpits and over the rear shoulder blades and then add 1-2 inches. That will give you the jacket size. Most jackets are available in short, regular, and long. If you are a weightlifter or very muscular you may want to go up one size. Please take the time to make sure the jacket and pants you are bidding on will fit you. If you need to exchange a jacket or pants for another size there will be a $20 fee which will cover my time and the cost of mailing the replacement.

The pants have a satin stripe. The shirt, vest, and tie is not included as I'm out of those. This one is dry clean only. It came from my tuxedo rental business and is in very nice condition. Have you checked the price of renting a Tuxedo lately??? This tuxedo rents for around $80 in most rental stores and that's for just one night!! . Why rent when you can own for less$$$??? Check out the other Tuxedos I have on eBay to save on shipping. At this price you can afford several!!

Sizing information: The most important measurement for the tuxedos is the chest which is measured all the way around just under the armpits and over the rear shoulder blades and then add 1-2 inches. That will give you the jacket size. Most jackets are available in short, regular, and long. If you are a weightlifter or very muscular you may want to go up one size. Please take the time to make sure the jacket and pants you are bidding on will fit you. If you need to exchange a jacket or pants for another size there will be a $20 fee which will cover my time and the cost of mailing the replacement.

The collar is notched, the waist is somewhat fitted, and the skirt of the coat is very full and hangs beautifully.

Happy Holidays! This particular party dress was purchased to wear to a wedding and I ended up a bridesmaid. I was a 4 at the time and am now a 6. I have had it hanging in the closet for 2 years and doubt that I will ever get back into it. There are tags and it has never been worn. The dress was purchased from an outlet store and is a size 4. I got it for 30% off the retail which is almost $200. It is doing me no good in my closet, so I am starting it low with NO RESERVE! This classic, sexy and easy to wear suit is perfectly suitable for a holiday party or evening out and is very sexy, though classically cut. Hugo is known for designing to fit REAL women and his clothes are cut for curves and flattering the body. He can make a gunny sack look sexy! It is a gorgeous ice pink satin. I don_t like pink, but this is a very subtle, icy color. The jacket has a front button close of pink, faux pearl buttons. The same buttons accent the sleeve cuffs. The jacket also has two besom-set pockets that are still sewn closed. It is a VERY flattering cut and reaches to just below the _BAD SPOT_ on your hips and I am 5_5_. The slim skirt is designed to end about 2_ above the knee and had a back slit, front and back darts and a button waist with back zip. Gorgeous as it is, I doubt that I will ever get back down into it, so I have no further use for this gorgeous suit. If this isn_t what you are looking for, check out my other auctions, as I am thinning my wardrobe of party dresses and formals as we never have formal occasions any more. Now shabby chic is in and we are having casual parties and fund raisers. I am even selling two of my full-length furs!

Birko-Flor is a man-made, leather-like fabric that's easy to care for and has little break-in time. The sandals have suede sock liners and are built on the original Birkenstock cork foot bed with molded heel cups that absorb shock and provide support. A toe bar encourages the natural gripping of the toes while the sandal's slip-on styling makes them easy to slide into. As a mark of style and quality, the gun metal buckles don the Birki's logo and the logo is also embossed on the outside of the shoe. Also adding to the style of the sandal is the variegated pattern of the straps' round perforations which go from larger to smaller. Brown (39) solid foot. Made in Germany NOTE: NEW CONDITION.

Brand new with tags (no box), these show light shelf wear and markings from handling. These are real Dr. Martens from England. Size UK 2 which is equal to a US womens 4 (UK+2) or boys US 3 (UK+1). Sole measures 10 inches from heel to toe. Pink and purple leather upper with Air Wair cushion sole. T-bar style with buckle. Very nice high quality expensive shoes that usually run in the $80-$100 range! Comes from a non-smoking home. Condition Range Scale: new/nwt-excellent-very good-good-fair-poor. All items have no known flaws (including rips, stains, known irregularities) unless stated otherwise. Payment and Shipping (International bidders see info below.) U.S. Shipping is $3.95 for Priority Mail. I do not charge a handling fee with Priority Mail. Estimated delivery is currently unpredictable, based on recent experience it can take anywhere from 3 to 15 days. Postal insurance is encouraged for an additional $1.10 (I am not responsible for items once they enter the postal system). I PREFER PAYPAL. I accept PayPal, money orders and cashier_s checks, all of which are shipped within 2-3 business days after I receive payment (M-F). Cash is strongly discouraged and is at your own risk (no change)! I also accept personal checks from bidders with 0 negative feedback regarding payment, but checks are least preferred and there is a 7-10 day hold on packages unless you have a feedback rating of 50+ positives with 0 negatives. There is a $10 fee in addition to pricey bank charges for bounced checks. Payment is due within 10 days of auction closing. I leave negative feedback to non-payers. I have to ask that buyers leave feedback first and I promise to return the favor for every timely payer. I am running out of ideas on how to encourage feedback (due to less than 20% of buyers leaving feedback). In the spirit of a true auction, ALL SALES ARE FINAL.
